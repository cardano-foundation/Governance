        "comment": "The Cardano Foundation's decision to vote “Yes” on the governance action defining the Cardano Vision and Roadmap for 2025 and beyond (Action ID: gov_action12meeq4r43udremwpm6fzt4nt7fctvt0ah7798x036m2r4nhlccmqqhmr9wx) reflects measured support for an essential step forward. We recognize the importance of a roadmap for aligning short-term objectives with long-term strategic goals.\n\nWe support several promising initiatives outlined in the roadmap, including Layer 1 scaling improvements (Leios), deeper integration of Mithril, innovations like Actively Validated Services, multiple node implementations, and programmable assets. These initiatives offer significant potential for enhancing network performance, resilience, and overall ecosystem growth.\n\nHowever, we also note concerns regarding certain elements in the roadmap. Specifically, the proposal revisits longstanding areas such as LSM Integration, which has been in progress for several years. Utilizing established industry-grade solutions would enhance reliability, reduce development risks, and accelerate delivery compared to rebuilding it from scratch. Additionally, the inclusion of zero-knowledge proofs to enable Cardano as a decentralized DeFi layer for Bitcoin appears misaligned with core roadmap priorities, given that the Plutus Virtual Machine already provides the necessary building blocks. While Leios is a promising initiative, many of the highlighted preparatory steps have already been completed, leaving limited new promise for 2025. Finally, the plan to generate libraries in various languages and empower developers to create custom chain indexers raises undue complexity and developer experience concerns. Additionally, achieving proposed or future roadmap items requires exploring innovative funding mechanisms beyond current models and increasing transparency and accountability in capital allocation.\n\nThe mutable nature of the provided reference link poses a risk to governance accountability.
