        "comment": "The delegate-approved Cardano Constitution is an improvement over the existing Interim Constitution. It reinforces the three-body governance model from CIP-1694 and establishes a token-based governance framework with checks and balances. In line with the Ethos and Principles outlined in  ‘Our Cardano’, particularly the core governance principle that Cardano’s governance processes must be accessible, transparent, decentralized, and adaptable, the new constitution upholds the resilient system of checks and balances anchored by ada and involving key governance groups, including the Constitutional Committee, Stake Pool Operators, and Delegated Representatives. For these reasons, the Cardano Foundation votes Yes on this governance action (Action ID: gov_action133jnaewfsq8x6v08ndd87l2yqryp63r30t2dkceacxx5cply5n7sqzlcyqf). The new constitution introduces several improvements compared to the interim version, including a set of ten Cardano Blockchain Tenets and a dedicated article for the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget. These enhancements help address previous shortcomings and provide a more flexible, transparent, and accountable governance framework. In our assessment, the delegate-approved Cardano Constitution meets the procedural and substantive requirements set by the Interim Constitution. By using cardano-cli, we have verified that the hash of the delegate-approved Cardano Constitution is identical to the version voted on by delegates at the Constitutional Convention, ensuring complete consistency and integrity. While the new constitution marks an advancement, we stress that future amendments will be necessary as the ecosystem evolves. It is also likely that governance challenges will arise going forward and will need to be addressed. Finally, further improvements in structure and clarity would expand the accessibility of the Cardano governance model and enhance its long-term viability. The Cardano Foundation is committed to playing an active role in this ongoing process, continuously contributing to the refinement and improvement of the Constitution. In summary, the delegate-approved Cardano Constitution enhances governance, deepens community participation, and lays a foundation for future development, making it a clear improvement over the Interim Constitution."
