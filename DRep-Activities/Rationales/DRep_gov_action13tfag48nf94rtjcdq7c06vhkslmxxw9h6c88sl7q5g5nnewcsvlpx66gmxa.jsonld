    "summary": "This document provides an aggregate rationale for the Cardano Foundation DRep’s votes on all Treasury Withdrawal GAs stemming from the approved “Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget - 275M ada Administered by Intersect” (gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh).",
    "rationaleStatement": "A [PDF version](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmRr6QBnkdNrb1GBpv3ePdTpnjKjPoQPfMyqwXhuwbLSHd) of this rationale is also made available.\n\n\n\n Our approach is designed to ensure both transparency and efficiency, applying a consistent evaluation framework (see [here](https://cardanofoundation.org/blog/navigating-budget-changes); the “Evaluation Framework”) to each proposal while presenting our reasoning in a single, comprehensive document.\n\nOur current assessment remains consistent with the principles previously outlined in our public communications and our evaluation during the Ekklesia off-chain signaling phase. As no material changes have been made to the individual proposals since the overarching budget was approved, our votes on these withdrawals reflect our original assessment of them. However, we have changed our previous abstention on the Intersect proposal and our previous “No” vote for the Discover Cardano proposal to a \"Yes\" vote.\n\nFund administration clarity is a crucial consideration for our voting decisions. While this budget is approved as a package, we expect Intersect, as administrator, to manage funds diligently, provide public transparency on contracts, and ensure robust oversight, holding recipients accountable for deliverables.\n\nOur voting decisions on the 39 treasury withdrawals are presented in the table below. The \"Vote\" column displays our votes. For all proposals requesting 3 million ada or more, our assessment is included in the \"Note\" column.\n\n\n\n\n## **Table A – Voting Record**\n\n| Governance Action ID | Title | Requested ADA | Vote | Note |\n| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |\n| gov\\_action13tfag48nf94rtjcdq7c06vhkslmxxw9h6c88sl7q5g5nnewcsvlqz6d98zp | 2025 Input Output Engineering Core Development Proposal | 96,817,080 | ABSTAIN | We abstain from both the TSC and IO Engineering proposals for the following different reasons:  For the TSC proposal, we abstain due to the lack of a credible execution path. Although we support the intent and approach and while we recognise the significant work that went into this proposal, the recent sudden withdrawal of administrative support by the Intersect board makes the proposal unfeasible, even if funded at this time.  For the IO Engineering proposal, we abstain as we are not confident that the current version offers sufficient transparency or accountability to justify endorsement. Our concerns stem from the lack of adjustments following constructive community feedback, particularly regarding scope, cost-effectiveness, and safeguards.

As the proposal did not fully account for CF's initial budget feedback nor propose activities linked to resolving known shortcomings, we will be monitoring these areas ahead of any subsequent budget proposals by Project Catalyst |\n| gov\\_action13tfag48nf94rtjcdq7c06vhkslmxxw9h6c88sl7q5g5nnewcsvlzqhm6e8q | Input Output Research (IOR): Cardano Vision \\- Work Program 2025 | 26,840,000 | ABSTAIN | We abstain from this proposal because we view key components of the proposed budget as materially too high, and previous feedback regarding costs and scope, including specific points raised by the Cardano Foundation on March 11 were not adequately addressed.

This reflects our acknowledgement of Intersect's revised 15.75M ada budget, recognizing Intersect's shift towards leaner operations.  Our initial vote to abstain based on the discrepancy between the on-chain proposal and the updated off-chain figures, which has been remedied now. We emphasize the importance of having accurate and updated details reflected directly on the Ekklesia platform for all future proposals to ensure transparency and streamline the DRep voting process. |\n| gov\\_action13tfag48nf94rtjcdq7c06vhkslmxxw9h6c88sl7q5g5nnewcsvlp5u7pqqr | Cardano Builder DAO | 12,000,000 | YES | We vote ‘yes’ on this proposal as it mitigates the dependency of Cardano on grants by exploring convertible grants to incentivise projects better.

treasury-withdrawal governance actions are the direct execution of a single, comprehensive review process that began during the off-chain signaling phase. Although we present one aggregate rationale for efficiency, each proposal and governance action was individually assessed against a consistent framework anchored in our publicly stated principles.\n\n### **Evaluation Framework**\n\nAs outlined in our blog post, Navigating Budget Changes, our evaluation is guided by several core criteria. For these treasury withdrawals, our assessment focused on three primary areas:\n\n- **Strategic Alignment:** We prioritized proposals that clearly align with the Cardano 2025 Vision & Roadmap and the principles of \"Our Cardano.\" Proposals demonstrating a direct contribution to core infrastructure, ecosystem growth, decentralization, and sustainability scored highest in our assessment.  \n- **Execution Viability & Financials:** We assessed whether the requested funding was appropriate with the project’s scope and whether the team demonstrated the expertise and planning necessary for successful execution. This included a review of the budget breakdown, timelines, and risk considerations.  \n- **Accountability and Delivery Assurance:** A critical factor was the proposal’s commitment to transparency and accountability. We looked for clear deliverables, defined success metrics, and robust reporting plans. Given the significant value of Treasury funds, we placed a strong emphasis on frameworks that ensure what is promised is ultimately delivered.",
