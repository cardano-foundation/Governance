    "summary": "The Cardano Foundation, as a DRep, votes YES on this info action. As the proposer, we are adding our vote to the rest of the community's to show support for this strategic, self-funded initiative. Securing the .ada and .cardano gTLDs is a great opportunity for the entire ecosystem.",
    "rationaleStatement": "A [PDF version][pdf-link] of this rationale is also made available.\n\n[pdf-link]: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmaSJguB46QP11NRHsB91stkzdojBsdMoEBJhz1QtYRHjb\n\nThis info action, submitted by the Cardano Foundation, serves a clear purpose: to gauge on-chain community sentiment and gather a formal record of support for a potential ICANN application for the .ada and .cardano gTLDs.\n\nOur decision to vote \"YES\" on our own proposal is based on the following:\n- **Our Role as a Community DRep:** The purpose of this info action is to measure community support. As a DRep, the Cardano Foundation represents not only its own organizational stance but also the will of the community members delegating their ada to our DRep. We are a part of the community, and we are voting for this strategic initiative on behalf of our delegators as we believe it would be a positive course of action.\n- **No Cost to the Treasury:** This is not a request for treasury funds. The Cardano Foundation has committed to using its own financial resources for the entire ICANN application and management process. This info action is purely a request for community endorsement, making it a simple and high-value proposition for ada holders to support. \n- **Strategic Importance:** Securing the .ada and .cardano gTLDs is a rare, time-sensitive opportunity that aligns with the upcoming ICANN application window in Q1 2026. These gTLDs are vital for the ecosystem's long-term brand protection, digital identity, and ability to foster Web2-to-Web3 innovations.\n- **Commitment to Community Governance:** The Cardano Foundation, as a non-profit dedicated to the development of Cardano as a public digital infrastructure, is the right long-term steward for this project. The proposal's plan to establish a dedicated Community Advisory Group to guide the gTLDs' development ensures this project will be managed in the ecosystem's best interest.",
    "conclusion": "The Cardano Foundation, as a DRep, votes YES. It is a clear, non-controversial step toward strengthening Cardano’s digital infrastructure without drawing on treasury resources. We invite the community to join us in supporting this important initiative.\n\n---\n\n> **_NOTE on 'Internal Voting':_**\n> The fields _constitutional_ and _unconstitutional_ below reflect the CF governance teams' individual opinions whether they are _for_ or _against_ the proposal. Reason for this inconsistency is, that CIP-136 is at the moment only applicable to CC rationales, but we want to record the internal opinions of our DRep assessment transparently as well.",
