    "summary": "The Cardano Foundation, as a DRep, votes YES on this NewCommittee governance action. We support this appointment in order to strengthen continuity and operational resilience of the Constitutional Committee.",
    "rationaleStatement": "A [PDF version][pdf-link] of this rationale is also made available.\n\n[pdf-link]: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmf2zBcXuNTQLy7C2rBGHsHG4JPU9AMVrsMsz4sygNGL5d\n\nThe Cardano Foundation recognises that the minimum required size for the Constitutional Committee (CC) is seven members, and that the appointment of Christina Gianelloni would increase the total membership to eight. \n\nWe acknowledge that increasing the total CC size to eight members has implications for CC approval thresholds, as the two-thirds majority requirement increases the absolute number of aligned votes needed for CC decisions, from five aligned votes, to six aligned votes, thereby marginally increasing individual members' veto power and may introduce additional coordination challenges, especially in scenarios of lower participation.\n\nNotwithstanding these implications, the Cardano Foundation supports this governance action based on the qualifications of the proposed candidate. Christina Gianelloni brings a strong track record in stewardship, operational leadership, and open-source governance through her roles as COO of Blink Labs and Head of the Board at PRAGMA. Her experience in governance processes is well aligned with the demands of the CC member.",
    "conclusion": "Taking into account both the governance threshold implications and the candidate’s demonstrated qualifications, the Cardano Foundation votes YES on this governance action and supports the appointment of the eighth member of the Constitutional Committee.\n\n---\n\n> **_NOTE on 'Internal Voting':_**\n> The fields _constitutional_ and _unconstitutional_ below reflect the CF governance teams' individual opinions whether they are _for_ or _against_ the proposal. Reason for this inconsistency is, that CIP-136 is at the moment only applicable to CC rationales, but we want to record the internal opinions of our DRep assessment transparently as well.",
