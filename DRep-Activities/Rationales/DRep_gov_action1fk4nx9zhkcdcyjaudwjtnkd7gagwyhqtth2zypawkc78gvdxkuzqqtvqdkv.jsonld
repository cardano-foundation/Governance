    "summary": "The Cardano Foundation, as a DRep, votes YES on this NewCommittee governance action. We recognise the necessity of bringing the Constitutional Committee (CC) up to the minimum size in order to ensure continuity until the next election in September 2026 (epoch 653).",
    "rationaleStatement": "A [PDF version][pdf-link] of this rationale is also made available.\n\n[pdf-link]: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmadvwZbTb3Ft3RSQMBExANijQb9Atc1MTrwgNo6S6McFz\n\nThe Cardano Foundation acknowledges the need to bridge the gap between resignation of the Cardano Atlantic Council and the next committee elections in September 2026 with a new committee member appointment. This will ensure that critical governance actions between now and September 2026 can be voted on by the CC, which will be restored to a functional state.\nWe trust that the new elected CC member Cardano Curia will vote promptly and conscientiously, with full consideration for the Cardano Constitution and the proper role of a Constitutional Committee member. \nNote: While this is not a counterargument per se, we also note that this NewCommittee governance action suggests that CC consideration is needed in respect of Net Change Limit governance actions. While consideration can of course be given, we do not think the CC needs to vote on such governance actions per the wording of the Constitution, which contains no such requirement.",
    "conclusion": "The Cardano Foundation, as a DRep, votes YES to this NewCommittee governance action.\n\n---\n\n> **_NOTE on 'Internal Voting':_**\n> The fields _constitutional_ and _unconstitutional_ below reflect the CF governance teams' individual opinions whether they are _for_ or _against_ the proposal. Reason for this inconsistency is, that CIP-136 is at the moment only applicable to CC rationales, but we want to record the internal opinions of our DRep assessment transparently as well.",
