    "summary": "The Cardano Foundation, as a DRep, votes YES on the Constitution v2.4 Governance Action. This version improves on the current Constitution by incorporating valuable on-chain feedback from the community. It strengthens accountability, improves clarity, and streamlines the governance process.",
    "rationaleStatement": "A [PDF version][pdf-link] of this rationale is also made available.\n\n[pdf-link]: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmZAgxcPodRCEHaVdFMuxeBPJe3UDUkmL2T7ZzW2hoqVVf\n\nOur support for this governance action is based on three key factors:\n\n1. **The Compromise: \"Ada Owner\" vs. \"Ada Holder\"** We view the reversion of the term \"ada Holder\" to \"ada owner\" as less precise, as it blurs the distinction between protocol-level access (holding keys) and legal ownership rights. However, we accept this regression to accommodate the concerns of other major stakeholders and unblock the constitutional amendment process.  \n\n2. **The Improvement: Streamlined Treasury & Governance Efficiency** We endorse the removal of the **Budget Info Action** requirement. This change aligns with our previous assessments (for v2.0 and v2.3), where we advocated for reducing bureaucratic friction. By consolidating the information requirements directly into the **Treasury Withdrawal** action, we eliminate a redundant administrative step without sacrificing accountability. This streamlining is essential to ensure the treasury can be deployed efficiently to support ecosystem growth and maintenance. Additionally, the new requirement for **immutable proposal documents** is an important security upgrade that protects the integrity of the governance process.  \n\n3. **The Continuity: A Maturing Framework** This version continues the work of maturing the Constitution from an aspirational document to an enforceable rulebook. The removal of non-binding \"expectations\" (such as Codes of Conduct) clarifies the document’s purpose: it is a set of hard rules for the ledger, not a social manifesto. This focus on enforceability is a necessary evolution for long-term stability.",

    "conclusion": "The Cardano Foundation votes YES. Constitution v2.4 represents a necessary improvement to Cardano’s governance model, with a focus on more efficient, less bureaucratic processes.\n\n`---`\n\n`> **_NOTE on 'Internal Voting':_**`\n\n`> The fields _constitutional_ and _unconstitutional_ below reflect the CF governance teams' individual opinions whether they are _for_ or _against_ the proposal. Reason for this inconsistency is, that CIP-136 is at the moment only applicable to CC rationales, but we want to record the internal opinions of our DRep assessment transparently as well.`",
