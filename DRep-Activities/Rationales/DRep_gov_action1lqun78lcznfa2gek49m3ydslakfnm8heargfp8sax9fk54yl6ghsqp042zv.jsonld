    "summary": "The Cardano Foundation, as a DRep, votes YES on this GA. As a member of the Steering Committee, we support this initiative. We view this 70,000,000 ada allocation as a necessary catalyst to integrate Cardano into the wider blockchain economy and secure the network's long-term economic sustainability",
    "rationaleStatement": "A [PDF version][pdf-link] of this rationale is also made available.\n\n[pdf-link]: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYaxGJj7pHdA1X2wfJm37qUase43y2av5RDaxVHhvqBQH\n\nThe rationale statement for this Treasury Withdrawal Governance Action mirrors the one provided for the corresponding Budget Info Action and is included below for community convenience and awareness.\n\nOur support for this proposal is grounded in our strategic vision for Cardano and our commitment to advancing the ecosystem.\n\n1. **Strategic Alignment and Roadmap:** This workstream complements and aligns with the Cardano Foundation’s new roadmap (https://cardanofoundation.org/blog/cardano-foundation-roadmap) announced in September 2025. In that roadmap, we prioritized \"Boosting Cardano DeFi\" and \"Cardano x Web3\" integrations as critical pillars for adoption. This Treasury Withdrawal effectively operationalizes those strategic goals, providing the necessary resources to close the infrastructure gap, specifically regarding stablecoins, oracles, and bridges, that currently limits our capacity in these areas.\n\n2. **A Catalyst for Sustainability:** We believe this initiative is the trigger needed to transition Cardano from a technically robust network to a commercially thriving one. By onboarding foundational utilities, we unlock the potential for high-volume DeFi and Real World Asset (RWA) applications. This activity is essential for generating the transaction fees required to ensure the long-term economic sustainability of the Cardano treasury and the network as a whole.\n\n3. **Governance Mandate:** We believe that obtaining a clear mandate from DReps through the associated Budget Info Action and this Treasury Withdrawal Governance Action is the correct governance approach for negotiating and executing these high-stakes integration deals. It respects the community’s role in authorizing strategic direction while allowing the Steering Committee the necessary agility to execute.\n\n4. **Collaboration and Accountability:** The Cardano Foundation is proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Input | Output Global, EMURGO, Intersect, and the Midnight Foundation on this critical mission. We are fully committed to delivering on the goals outlined in this proposal. We will hold ourselves and our fellow Steering Committee members accountable to these shared objectives and expectations, and we invite the community and DReps to hold us accountable as well.\n\n---\n\n## Disclosure of Involvement\nThe Cardano Foundation is a member of the Steering Committee and contributor to this proposal. Our vote as a DRep reflects our conviction that this is the right path for Cardano. The Cardano Foundation is a member of the Intersect Oversight Committee and responsible for data assurance and verification in assisting Intersect ensure that withdrawals from its smart contract framework are correctly made. If there is a conflict between this role and a smart contract disbursement under the associated budget, the Cardano Foundation will recuse itself from the affected decision in line with the Oversight Committee code of conduct.",
    "conclusion": "The Cardano Foundation votes **YES**. We are committed to pushing the entire ecosystem forward to ensure a sustainable future for all participants. This Treasury Withdrawal provides the essential means to achieve that future, and we are ready to work alongside our partners to deliver these critical integrations.\n\n---\n\n\n> **_NOTE on 'Internal Voting':_**\n> The fields _constitutional_ and _unconstitutional_ below reflect the CF governance teams' individual opinions whether they are _for_ or _against_ the proposal. Reason for this inconsistency is, that CIP-136 is at the moment only applicable to CC rationales, but we want to record the internal opinions of our DRep assessment transparently as well.",
