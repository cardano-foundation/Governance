    "motivations": "The Foundation believes in collaboration, in working hand-in-hand with the community while also promoting innovation. And we strive to do so while upholding integrity, transparency, inclusivity, and maintaining sustainable practices. We vote both to empower the ecosystem and drive adoption by facilitating the onboarding of various organizations to Cardano.",
    "objectives": "The Cardano Foundation aims to encourage wider participation in the Cardano ecosystem and ensure that Cardano remains a long-lasting, robust blockchain fit for building innovation. We look to eight core elements as criteria to keep it a secure, inclusive, and sustainable network: accessibility; decentralization; security and resilience; scalability; viable economic models; educational resources; the infrastructure’s core development; and governance itself.",
    "qualifications": "Founded in 2016, the Cardano Foundation is an independent, Swiss-based not-for-profit advancing Cardano as a public infrastructure across a wide range of industries.\n\nOur efforts have resulted in collaborations with UN organizations, commercial sectors, and universities, among others. We also contribute to the creation and maintenance of several open-source tools, and have developed the Cardano Academy for easy access to high-quality blockchain education.\n\nStarting in 2018, we support a global network of multilingual volunteers via the Cardano Ambassador Program to amplify community engagement. In 2025, the Foundation published the first ever Cardano Ecosystem Guide.\n\nSince 2023, in line with our commitment to transparency, we share a yearly Financial Insights Report. And in 2025 we made our underlying regulatory data available on Reeve, a financial reporting solution built on Cardano.\n\nThe Foundation’s Reports and Governance pages provide further details.",
