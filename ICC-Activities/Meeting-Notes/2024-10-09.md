## Summary  

The team discussed ambiguities in the Constitutional Committee’s (CC) role in voting on info actions, emphasizing the importance of clear rationales. Proposals to publish meeting minutes were also considered to enhance transparency towards the community.

## Details  

### Ambiguity in CC Role for Info Actions  

The team reviewed ambiguities in the CC’s role regarding info actions. While the constitution defines the CC as an evaluator of constitutionality, info actions could be misinterpreted as expressing opinions. The team suggested potential constitutional amendments to clarify this role.

### Voting on Info Actions  

The team agreed to vote "yes" on info actions that meet constitutional requirements, emphasizing the importance of active engagement. Rationales must clearly state that votes assess constitutionality, not the content’s merits.

### Info Action Rationale  

To ensure consistency and streamline the assessment process, a standardized rationale template for info actions was proposed. This template would focus on key formalities, such as hash consistency and alignment with constitutional provisions.

### Transparency and Public Perception  

To address the need for greater transparency, it was agreed to publish meeting minutes on the Cardano Forum.

### Constitutional Boundaries  

The team reiterated the importance of adhering to constitutional boundaries, emphasizing that expressing opinions as the CC would violate Article 6, Section 1. Other governance mechanisms allow members to voice personal opinions in their roles as DReps or SPOs.
