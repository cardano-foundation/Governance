## Summary  

The team discussed governance action dissemination, the constitutionality of the `stakePoolTargetNum` parameter adjustment, and the importance of a consistent process for sharing information. The “Should K be increased?” proposal was rejected due to insufficient supporting materials.

## Details  

### Governance Action Discussion  

The team explored methods to share information on governance actions through social media and the Cardano Forum. The need for a consistent process to ensure transparency and respect for the community was addressed.

### Governance Action Assessment  

Discussions on the K parameter proposal highlighted concerns about its quality and self-promotional nature. While the action’s merits were acknowledged, its constitutionality was questioned due to the lack of relevant supporting materials.

### ICC Decision  

The decision to reject the proposal was based on constitutional criteria and the need to set a high standard for future actions. Feedback was offered to the proposers to encourage resubmission of a more robust and compliant action.
