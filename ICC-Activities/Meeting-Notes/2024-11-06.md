## Summary  

The team addressed several governance actions, including the “Should K be increased?” proposal and an erroneous Plutus cost model change, both of which were deemed unconstitutional. Discussions also focused on the ICC’s role in assessing proposal quality and the publication of meeting notes for transparency.

## Details  

### Constitutional Committee's Role and K Increase Proposal  

The “Should K be increased?” proposal was reviewed and found unconstitutional due to the violation of Article 3, Section 6, and insufficient supporting materials. While criticisms arose on social media, the decision was clarified as a constitutional assessment rather than an opinion on the proposal’s merits.

### Governance Action 004: Erroneous Parameter Change  

The erroneous governance action (GA#4) was determined unconstitutional due to a metadata error and its misalignment with the constitution. The team highlighted the importance of referencing relevant constitutional articles when drafting rationales.

### Governance Actions and Future Votes  

The team discussed the need to clarify the ICC’s role in assessing the quality of proposals. Emphasis was placed on ensuring constitutional compliance without overstepping into proposal quality evaluation.

### Plutus Cost Model Change Proposal  

The valid Plutus V3 cost model change proposal was reviewed and found constitutionally sound as it merely added new cost model parameters. Consistency with existing guardrails and the development of robust rationales were emphasized.

### Meeting Notes Publication  

The team agreed to publish meeting notes retroactively on a new governance page for improved transparency. While forum posts were considered as a short-term measure, the website was prioritized for long-term accessibility and better structure for readers.
