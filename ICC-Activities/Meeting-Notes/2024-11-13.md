## Summary  

Discussions focused on two governance actions related to the Plutus V3 cost model changes: an erroneous action and a valid change adding parameters to the existing model. The team deliberated the implications of these actions, particularly regarding the risk of soft forks, SPO participation, and synchronization requirements. A thorough review was initiated to ensure compliance with constitutional requirements and set precedents for future decisions.

## Details  

### Erroneous Governance Action  

The team examined an erroneous governance action (GA#4) to update the Plutus V3 cost model, determining it unconstitutional due to violations of Article 3, Section 6, and a broken metadata file link. The importance of promptly submitting voting recommendations was emphasized, with final approval to be sought from the executive committee.

### Valid Plutus V3 Cost Model Change  

The valid Plutus V3 cost model change was discussed, focusing on the technical rationale and ensuring alignment with constitutional guardrails. It was noted that the proposed parameters would not affect existing smart contracts.

### Hard Fork Considerations  

The team reviewed the potential hard fork implications of adding new Plutus cost model parameters. While these changes do not require an on-chain hard fork initiation, they effectively function as hard forks due to their impact on nodes. Stake pool operators (SPOs) were identified as critical in ensuring the networkâ€™s readiness for such protocol changes.

### SPOs and Governance  

Concerns were raised about SPO participation and governance, particularly regarding exchanges upgrading their stake pools prematurely, which could destabilize the network. SPO voting thresholds for governance actions were discussed in detail, referencing requirements outlined in the interim constitution.

### SPO Participation  

SPO voting behavior was analyzed, emphasizing topic-driven motivation and the tendency to vote in the last epoch. Historical differences between SPO polls and on-chain votes were noted, underscoring the importance of tailoring governance mechanisms to stakeholder needs.
