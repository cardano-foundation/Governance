## Summary  

The Governance Advisory Team reviewed several topics, including a governance action proposing to rename the Chang 2 hard fork to Plomin hard fork in memory of Matthew Plomin, and the governance action to update the Plutus V3 cost model parameters. The team agreed to assess the constitutionality of the renaming proposal and recommend a "yes" vote for the cost model update. They also discussed posting meeting notes on the Cardano Forum for transparency and proposed recognizing team members in the notes.

## Details  

### Renaming Chang 2 Hard Fork to Plomin Hard Fork  

The team discussed the proposal to rename the Chang 2 hard fork to Plomin hard fork. While there was deliberation regarding the lack of a formal process for naming hard forks in the constitution, the team decided that voting on the proposal was within their role as constitutional assessors. The discussion highlighted that abstention was not preferred, and the team agreed to proceed with an internal assessment process.

### Plutus V3 Cost Model Parameter Change  

For the Plutus V3 cost model parameter change, the team confirmed their recommendation to vote "yes," with a majority already in agreement. A rationale for the decision will be drafted and shared with the executive committee, communications, and legal teams for review.

### Governance Advisory Team Meeting Notes  

The publication of meeting notes was also addressed. The team agreed to publish notes retroactively on the Cardano Foundation website in the future. They emphasized the need for brevity and an approval process before publication.

### Governance Advisory Team Member Recognition  

In recognition of the Governance Advisory Teamâ€™s efforts, the idea of listing team members in meeting notes was proposed and met with general agreement, leaving the final decision to individual members.
