## Summary  

The meeting focused on the Plomin hard fork governance action, which has met the SPO approval threshold of 51% and awaits the required votes from the Interim Constitutional Committee (ICC). Discussions centered on node version adoption rates, security risks, and the rationale for approving the action. The team debated the transparency of the hotfix process and its impact on governance. Further discussions explored the ICC’s role in governance oversight, the need for improved security communication, and upcoming governance actions, including the budget process and new constitution submission.

## Details  

### Hard Fork Governance Action and Security Considerations

The hard fork governance action has met the required SPO approval threshold, with 62% voting in favor. ICC ratification has to happen until Friday, 24 January 2025, the last possible moment for passage. Node version 10.1.4 adoption is at 91%, significantly reducing the likelihood of a DOS attack. Even with some nodes still on older versions, the probability of a successful attack is minimal.

### Vote on Hard Fork and Rationale Development

Initially, five members supported the action while two opposed it. Concerns about the small number of outdated nodes enabling a theoretical attack were raised but ultimately deemed unlikely due to the visibility of such an attack and the measurements that can be taken if it would happen. The decision was made to proceed with a “yes” vote, incorporating feedback on the mempool ledger rule additions into the rationale. The final rationale will be distributed via email, addressing concerns about the hotfix process and adoption communication.

### Transparency and Communication Challenges

The team debated the lack of transparency in hotfix adoption and previous hard fork issues, particularly the absence of post-mortems or clear explanations. Concerns were raised that decision-making should be more transparent, allowing stakeholders to understand security and governance challenges fully. A neutral approach to highlighting these challenges in the rationale was proposed to maintain focus on constitutional review.

### ICC Role in Governance and Future Oversight

The ICC’s role is limited to assessing the constitutionality of governance actions, with no direct authority over technical security measures. The only grounds for deeming the action unconstitutional would have been a perceived violation of Article 3, Section 6, which was not substantiated. However, the discussion highlighted the need for clearer governance structures to define the responsibilities of different ecosystem participants.

### Security Disclosure and Open Communication

A debate arose over whether security concerns should be discussed in open forums or restricted channels. Some members argued that transparency is necessary to drive improvements, while others emphasized that sensitive security information should not be publicly available to prevent exploitation. The discussion extended to concerns about IOG’s software development practices and the allocation of resources within the ecosystem.

### Upcoming Governance Actions and Budget Process

Several upcoming governance actions were outlined, including the submission of a new constitution, and the net change limit info action. The budget process was also discussed, with concerns about delays in budget submission and the need for more structured communication from the budget committee.
