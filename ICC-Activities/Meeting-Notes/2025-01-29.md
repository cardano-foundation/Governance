## Details  

### New Constitution Governance Action and Voting Process

The New Constitution governance action will be submitted before 31 January 2025, triggering a six-epoch assessment period. This marks the first governance action where all DReps can vote beyond info actions. The Foundation reaffirmed its stance to approve the constitution via its own DREP but not delegate genesis ada to it, as previously communicated in the forum FAQ. Two protocols will be followed: one for assessing constitutionality as an ICC member and another for voting on the action as a DRep.

### DRep Approval Process and Structural Improvements

The DRep approval process will mirror the ICC approach, maintaining representatives from relevant teams within the Foundation. To address inefficiencies, suggestions included streamlining approval chains, and involving PMO support. A structural change was considered, dividing the team into subject matter experts for consultation and a core administrative team to manage approvals.

### Meeting Frequency and Process Optimization

The team discussed optimizing meeting frequency, with some favoring fewer meetings unless urgent, while others valued real-time discussions over asynchronous processes. A proposed improvement was to involve legal and comms teams earlier in the approval process of the voting rationales to prevent bottlenecks and improve efficiency.

### Voting Strategy and Decision-Making Approach

Voting strategy was discussed, emphasizing the importance of timely votes. Clearly unconstitutional actions should be rejected immediately, while treasury withdrawals and budget-related governance actions should be approached with patience, ensuring sufficient community approvals are in place before proceeding. Using pre-written templates was suggested to streamline decisions on unconstitutional actions.

### Publication of Meeting Notes and Transparency

The value of publishing meeting notes was debated, as governance rationales already provide detailed insights. The team agreed to proceed with publishing notes to promote transparency, set a standard for future CC members, and ensure no sensitive information is disclosed. The notes will avoid attributing statements to individuals while maintaining a clear record of discussions.
