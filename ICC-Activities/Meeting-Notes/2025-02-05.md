## Summary  

The meeting focused on the [New Constitution governance action](https://adastat.net/governances/8c653ee5c9800e6d31e79b5a7f7d4400c81d44717ad4db633dc18d4c07e4a4fd00), assessing its constitutionality and potential post-implementation concerns. The team reviewed the action against the interim constitution’s articles and guardrails, finding no constitutional violations, despite recognizing flaws in the newly proposed constitution. A prior commitment to vote “yes” with the Cardano Foundation DRep was reaffirmed, and the team discussed concerns regarding potential future violations related to introduced Cardano Tenets. Next steps for the team include providing their individual recommendations and drafting rationales for both ICC and DRep votes, ensuring alignment with the Interim Constitution and previous commitments.

## Details  

### Administrative Updates and Process Automation

The process documentation and rationale templates were updated to reflect the dual role of DRep and ICC member, ensuring a clear distinction in responsibilities. The team discussed automating governance action tracking by implementing a bot that reads governance actions from Cardano mainnet, reducing manual workload and improving efficiency.

### Constitutionality Review and Voting Commitment

The new constitution governance action was reviewed against the interim constitution’s guardrails and articles, with no violations identified. The team agreed that despite potential flaws, it meets constitutional requirements and must be assessed independently of subjective opinions. The prior commitment to approve the new constitution via the Cardano Foundations DRep was reaffirmed, as it was publicly communicated in FAQs and other governance discussions. The team confirmed that altering the stance now would contradict previous commitments and could create governance uncertainty.

### Potential Constitutional Violations Post-Implementation

Concerns were raised about mempool ledger rules potentially violating TENET 1 of the proposed constitution draft, particularly regarding transaction censorship. However, it was clarified that censorship is SPO-controlled and not enforced at the blockchain level, meaning SPOs can choose whether to implement these rules. Additionally, discussions touched on how future amendments could address any issues that arise post-implementation, ensuring that governance evolves as needed.

### Analysis of Article 4 and Budget Management

The review of Article 4 (Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget) highlighted key improvements, including mandatory periodic audits for treasury withdrawals, rather than audits being required only above a certain amount. Concerns were raised about enforcing restrictions on staking funds received from the treasury, with suggestions that smart contracts could help mitigate this risk by preventing governance conflicts related to staking rewards. Once funds are out of the treasury there is no way of controlling if these funds are staked to a pool or a DRep.

### Enforceability and Social Contract

It was emphasized that the guardrail script is the only truly enforceable mechanism in the constitution, while other aspects function as a social contract that relies on adherence by governance participants. The discussion reinforced the importance of ensuring that governance expectations remain realistic and enforceable within technical constraints.

### Voting Snapshot and Next Steps

The team reviewed the current DRep voting snapshot on the new constitution governance action, noting discrepancies across governance explorers. As some DReps’could become inactive while the New Constitution governance action is life, the approval percentage may shift even without additional votes. The next step for the team is for members of the team to provide their official recommendation and for the team to draft the rationales for both ICC and DRep votes while ensuring alignment with previous commitments. Additionally, the team will raise concerns about the net change limit hold-up in an upcoming ICC call to expedite the process and prevent unnecessary delays in governance.
