## Details  

### New Constitution Governance Action and Voting Schedule

The team confirmed that the voting process for the new constitution is nearing completion, pending final legal approval for both the ICC and DRep rationales. The ICC vote is expected to occur first, followed by the DRep vote the next day, allowing time for the rationale to be reviewed. The results will be announced via social media, and the Cardano Forum.

### Post-Vote Actions and GitHub Updates

Following the votes, the necessary actions include updating the repository by uploading the rationales to GitHub for public visibility. The team will also ensure proper communication of the results and coordinate the voting decisions with the appropriate internal teams.

### Process for Amending the Constitution

Although there is an on-chain mechanism for submitting a new constitution, no formal off-chain amendment process has been established. The group acknowledged the potential inefficiency of frequent minor modifications and proposed creating an inclusive approach that batches changes and builds consensus before submitting amendments on-chain.
