summary: "During the meeting on 19 February 2025, the team confirmed that the new Cardano Constitution has been ratified meeting the required DRep (75%) and ICC (66%) approval threshold and examined a newly submitted Protocol Parameter Change governance action to reduce the treasury cut from 20% to 10%. Discussions focused on the proposal’s compliance with constitutional guardrails, the sufficiency of supporting data and technical review, the adequacy of a reversion plan, and its potential long-term impact on network economic parameters. The team agreed to further review the proposal from both ICC and DRep perspectives and to incorporate additional analysis before voting on the governance action."

## Summary  

During the meeting on 19 February 2025, the team confirmed that the new Cardano Constitution has been ratified meeting the required DRep (75%) and ICC (66%) approval threshold and examined a newly submitted Protocol Parameter Change governance action to reduce the treasury cut from 20% to 10%. Discussions focused on the proposal’s compliance with constitutional guardrails, the sufficiency of supporting data and technical review, the adequacy of a reversion plan, and its potential long-term impact on network economic parameters. The team agreed to further review the proposal from both ICC and DRep perspectives and to incorporate additional analysis before voting on the governance action.

## Details  

### Constitution Ratification and Governance Action Introduction

It was announced that the new Cardano Constitution has been ratified, meeting the required DRep and ICC approval threshold, even surpassing the required threshold, and will replace the interim constitution once the governance action becomes enacted on Sunday, February 23, 2025. Concurrently, a new governance action to reduce the treasury cut parameter from 20% to 10% was introduced, drawing attention to its unexpected submission without extensive off-chain discussion.

### Analysis of the Treasury Cut Proposal

Detailed analysis was conducted on the proposal’s compliance with constitutional guardrails. Concerns were raised over the absence of sufficient supporting data and a formal technical review, while counterarguments highlighted that external discussions and historical analysis provided adequate context. Furthermore, it was noted that the actual treasury cut goes well beyond 20%, which could be an argument for lowering the parameter.

### Constitutional Interpretation and Reversion Plan

A significant portion of the discussion centered on interpreting constitutional requirements, particularly the need for a clearly defined reversion or recovery plan, as indicated in section 2.6 of the guardrails appendix, within the proposal’s metadata. Some participants suggested that a simple reversion would suffice, given the minimal direct impact on ledger operations. In contrast, others stressed the importance of an explicit plan to safeguard long-term network sustainability and clarify constitutional ambiguities.

### Impact Assessment and Next Steps

The team also evaluated the potential immediate versus delayed effects of the proposed treasury cut change, debating its influence on delegation behavior and overall network stability. It was agreed that further review is necessary, including additional data analysis and simulations, and consolidated recommendations reflecting both ICC and DRep perspectives will be prepared ahead of the 15 March governance action expiration date.
