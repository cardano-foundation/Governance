title: "ICC Governance Meeting - 26 February 2025"
date: "2025-02-26"
summary: "On 26 February 2025, the Governance Advisory Team reviewed the Parameter Change governance action to reduce the treasury growth rate from 20% to 10%. The majority raised concerns over the lack of sufficient data, detailed technical analysis, and an absent reversion plan, all of which could jeopardize constitutional safeguards and the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem. Although one member expressed a conditional “Yes” from a DRep perspective, the consensus was to vote “No,” both as a DRep and ICC member and to provide constructive feedback and guidance via the voting rationales for future proposals, with plans to cast the DRep vote early in week 10 of 2025, followed by the ICC vote shortly thereafter."

## Summary  

On 26 February 2025, the Governance Advisory Team reviewed the [Parameter Change governance action](https://adastat.net/governances/941502b0aa104c850d197923259444d2b57cab7af18b63143775465aaacc84f500) to reduce the treasury growth rate from 20% to 10%. The majority raised concerns over the lack of sufficient data, detailed technical analysis, and an absent reversion plan, all of which could jeopardize constitutional safeguards and the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem. Although one member expressed a conditional “Yes” from a DRep perspective, the consensus was to vote “No,” both as a DRep and ICC member and to provide constructive feedback and guidance via the voting rationales for future proposals, with plans to cast the ICC vote in week 10 of 2025, followed by the DRep vote shortly thereafter.

## Details  

### Treasury Growth Rate Decrease Governance Action

The [governance action](https://adastat.net/governances/941502b0aa104c850d197923259444d2b57cab7af18b63143775465aaacc84f500) under review proposes decreasing the treasury growth rate parameter from 20% to 10% and remains active until 15 March. Participants noted that the proposal suffers from insufficient supporting data, inadequate analysis, and the absence of a constitutionally required reversion plan, all of which could set a concerning precedent for future parameter changes.

### CF DRep Perspective

From a DRep perspective, members emphasized that while changes to economic parameters are encouraged, they must be substantiated by robust analytical evidence. The majority recommended a “No” vote as DRep, arguing that the proposal’s assumptions are unsubstantiated and potentially risky. One member was considering a “Yes” vote based on the proposal’s alignment with existing guidelines. However, the lack of clear impact proof was recognized, highlighting the need for independent validation for future proposals. It was also highlighted that we would be happy to support the proposers by providing the necessary data to refine their proposal.

### ICC Perspective

From an ICC standpoint, the members questioned the proposal’s constitutionality due to its insufficient technical review and lack of supporting materials. They highlighted that the proposal may breach constitutional requirements, specifically Article 3, Section 5, and noted that the required reversion plan, as outlined in Appendix 1, Section 2.6, was missing. Both these deficiencies contradict the “long-term sustainability” mandate in TENET 9. This perspective underscored the risk that approving such changes without substantial evidence could compromise the long-term sustainability and security of the Cardano network.

### Next Steps

The team agreed to provide detailed feedback and recommendations to enhance the evidence and analysis for future proposals. Formal votes are planned to proceed with an ICC vote in week 10 of 2025, followed by a DRep vote shortly thereafter, accompanied with a voting rationale, ensuring that the decision-making process remains constructive and transparent.
