## Summary  

On 05 March 2025, the Governance Advisory Team focused on several key governance topics including the parameter change governance action to reduce the treasury cut, an info action addressing the 2025 vision and roadmap, and DRep delegation strategy. Discussions examined procedural order, constitutional concerns regarding mutable data links, and the balance between increased influence and maintaining accountability, with clear next steps identified.

## Details  

### Parameter Change Governance Action

A team member presented the finalized ICC voting rationale for reducing the treasury cut from 20% to 10%. The group discussed the optimal voting sequence, proposing that the ICC vote precede the CF DRep vote.

### Info Action on 2025 Vision and Roadmap

The team discussed the [info action](https://adastat.net/governances/56f39054758f1a3cedc1de9225d66bf270b62dfdbfbc5399f1d6d43aceffc63600) submitted by the Product Committee of Intersect to gather opinions on a proposed vision and roadmap for Cardano in 2025 and beyond. Participants expressed concerns about the use of a non-immutable link in the proposal’s metadata, which risked binding early votes to content that might later change, potentially conflicting with constitutional principles. The group agreed to seek further clarification and engage in discussions with fellow iCC members on this issue while continuing their independent assessment of the governance action.

### Moving Forward

The team outlined the immediate next steps, with a designated representative set to consult with key stakeholders about the possibility of holding a vote that questions the constitutionality of the info action. It was decided that the ICC vote on the treasury cut would proceed as scheduled and that further deliberation on the vision and roadmap info action’s constitutional implications would occur in the following days.

### Delegation Strategy

Discussion focused on leveraging the Foundation’s ada to enhance governance participation. A hybrid approach was suggested, gradually increasing delegation to the CF DRep while selectively delegating voting power to community DReps. Concerns about potential community backlash if delegation was increased without forewarning were raised. With this in mind, the necessity for transparent, measurable criteria were acknowledged, with consensus supporting an incremental strategy paired with clear communication. Community DReps should not be chosen based on their alignment with the Foundation, but rather on promoting good governance participation.
