## Summary  

The advisory team examined the implications of the new constitution on governance actions, focusing on info actions, mutable metadata, and the distinct roles involved in voting on budget proposals, net change limit (NCL), and the current info action regarding the Cardano roadmap and vision for 2025 and beyond. Discussions highlighted the need for consistency in voting practices, debating whether to record votes on non-binding info actions, emphasizing the importance of using immutable metadata for transparency, and balancing on-chain voting participation with detailed rationale. The team also explored enhancements to meeting note transparency and discoverability to support ongoing community engagement.

## Details  

### Governance Action Voting with the New Constitution

The team discussed the impact of the [new Constitution](https://constitution.gov.tools/en/constitution) on info actions, clarifying that while info actions have no direct on-chain effect and are, according to the constitution (Article VII, Section 4), neither constitutional nor unconstitutional, each Constitutional Committee member retains the right to record a vote on the constitutionality of info actions. For budget-related and treasury withdrawal info actions, the CC shall record a vote on the actions’ constitutionality. Members noted the inherent confusion in the current wording of the constitution and stressed the importance of distinguishing process adherence from outcome evaluation.

### CC Voting on Info Actions

Members debated whether the CC should actively vote on info actions to signal their position, given that any vote, whether affirmative or an abstention, could have implications for subsequent governance actions. The discussion underscored the need for a consistent approach, as an affirmative vote on an info action might be interpreted as a commitment in future evaluations, prompting some to favor abstention as a clearer signal of process oversight.

### Mutable Metadata in Governance Actions

Concerns were raised regarding the use of [mutable metadata](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blockchainada/ga/refs/heads/main/ga01.jsonld) in governance actions, including mutable metadata anchor URLs and mutable links in references, with arguments that such mutable links compromise transparency and hinder the ability to verify the initial content. The committee proposed that, in cases where mutable metadata links are used, the file should be uploaded to immutable storage and referenced in their voting rationales to ensure a verifiable record of the proposal’s content.

### Voting on Net Change Limit and Budget

The discussion clarified that while determining the net change limit falls under the remit of DReps, the CC’s role is to assess whether future budget proposals comply with that limit. It was agreed that advisory team members provide their separate voting recommendations on the [net change limit info action](https://cardanoscan.io/govAction/gov_action10ueqgzwenxr39le68n0se9peu92r7gm2846xwehh3u0ahc0qd0uqqyljxu5). Although the NCL is an info action, it remains critical that the CC ensures the process conforms to constitutional requirements.

### DRep Voting on the Cardano Vision and Roadmap Info Action

Shifting focus to the [Cardano vision and roadmap info action](https://adastat.net/governances/56f39054758f1a3cedc1de9225d66bf270b62dfdbfbc5399f1d6d43aceffc63600) from a DRep perspective, members expressed mixed views on the Cardano roadmap. While some criticized its presentation and language, the overall strategic direction was considered acceptable. The dialogue emphasized the need for constructive feedback on the roadmap’s content and process, resulting in a consensus to vote affirmatively while continuing to refine the roadmap through community input. Additional details can be found on the [2025 Vision and Roadmap page](https://product.cardano.intersectmbo.org/vision-roadmap-2025/).
  
### On-Chain Voting and Rationale Transparency

The group explored the benefits and drawbacks of casting an abstention vote versus not voting on info actions, noting that each approach sends a different signal to the community. It was argued that casting an abstention vote, accompanied by a detailed rationale, ensures full participation in the governance process while preserving transparency. The discussion also addressed the need to record detailed explanations without compromising the confidentiality of internal deliberations.

### Improving Meeting Note Transparency and Discoverability

Finally, the team considered measures to enhance the transparency and accessibility of meeting documentation. Suggestions included fully recording meetings, referencing notes in voting rationales for easier retrieval, and publishing cleaned-up summaries that balance internal detail with public clarity. These measures aim to create a more comprehensive and searchable archive of governance deliberations while maintaining necessary confidentiality where appropriate.
