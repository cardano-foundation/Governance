## Summary  

Discussions centered on coordinating votes for the 'Defining the Vision and Roadmap' info action and assessing two competing Net Change Limit (NCL) proposals, including deliberations on their parameters, the 50%+1 lovelace approval threshold, and process implications. Broader governance system concerns regarding potential paralysis, constitutional interpretation, and proposal quality were also debated, reflecting differing views on system health. Immediate next steps include voting on the info action and continuing the review and deliberation process for both NCL proposals.

## Details  

### Governance Action Voting Plan

The immediate plan involves submitting votes for the 'Defining the Vision and Roadmap' info action, first from the DRep perspective and subsequently as an ICC member, confirming the action's constitutionality. Concurrently, the team continues to assess two active NCL governance actions: one submitted anonymously on March 16th proposing specific NCLs for 2025 (300 million ada) and 2026 (250 million ada), and a second submitted by Intersect proposing a different NCL (350 million ada) for the period from Epoch 532 to 604 (effectively calendar year 2025). The team aims to finalize its recommendation on the first NCL action by the following week, before thoroughly reviewing the Intersect proposal.

### Net Change Limit (NCL) Deliberations

Significant discussion centered on the two NCL proposals. Deliberations included the specific amounts proposed (300M/250 million ada vs. 350 million ada for 2025), the implications of the 50%+1 lovelace DRep approval threshold, as defined in guardrails TREASURY-01a, required for NCL actions, and whether this threshold appropriately balances safety with the risk of inaction. The process for updating the NCL itself was discussed, considering the timing and potential confusion arising from having two competing proposals active simultaneously. The team explored arguments for and against different limits and the rationale behind the specific thresholds defined in the Constitution.

### Governance System & Process Concerns

Broader concerns about the governance framework were debated, touching upon the risk of governance paralysis if high thresholds or community division hinder decision-making. The role and interpretive power of the Constitutional Committee in assessing governance actions were considered. Furthermore, participants discussed the perceived lack of robust quality assessment mechanisms and coordination challenges in the DRep budget proposal review process, due to the recent Intersect budget process pivot. Contrasting viewpoints emerged regarding the overall state of the governance system: some expressed significant pessimism about its current flaws and potential vulnerabilities, while others advocated for an optimistic, iterative approach focused on learning and incremental improvement, emphasizing the need to move forward despite challenges.
