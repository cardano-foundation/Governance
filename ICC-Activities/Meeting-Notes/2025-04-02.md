title: "ICC Governance Meeting - 02 April 2025"
date: "2025-04-02"
summary: "The meeting focused on reviewing two competing Net Change Limit (NCL) info actions, noting their current low approval rates and discussing their constitutional standing. Deliberations leaned towards recommending a 'no' vote on the anonymous proposal and a 'yes' on Intersect's proposal from a DRep perspective, citing reasons related to timing and enabling treasury access, while considering both actions likely constitutional. Plans were established to finalize recommendations for ICC voting on April 9th and DRep voting on April 10th, alongside coordinating internal processes and external communications."

## Summary  

The meeting focused on reviewing two competing Net Change Limit (NCL) info actions, noting their current low approval rates and discussing their constitutional standing. Deliberations leaned towards recommending a 'no' vote on the anonymous proposal and a 'yes' on Intersect's proposal from a DRep perspective, citing reasons related to timing and enabling treasury access, while considering both actions likely constitutional. Plans were established to finalize recommendations for ICC voting on April 9th and DRep voting on April 10th, alongside coordinating internal processes and external communications.

## Details  

### Previous Governance Action Results

A review of the recently concluded 'Defining the Cardano Vision and Roadmap for 2025 and beyond' info action noted its 64% approval rate from DReps; however, it was highlighted that the Intersect Constitutional Council (ICC) had deemed this specific info action unconstitutional.

### Net Change Limit (NCL) Info Action Review

The core discussion involved assessing the two active NCL info actions: one submitted by anonymous community members (currently ~24%  DRep approval) and one from Intersect (~21% approval). While the nature of "info actions" for setting the NCL was deliberated, the prevailing view leaned towards considering both proposals as constitutionally valid. Arguments were presented favoring Intersect's proposal, particularly its defined one-year scope allowing for timely treasury access and evaluation, compared to the anonymous proposal's two-year timeframe. From a DRep voting perspective, various positions were considered (No/Yes, Yes/Yes, Abstain/Abstain), with the emerging inclination favoring support for the Intersect action ('yes') while rejecting the anonymous one ('no').

### Voting Timeline & Communication Strategy

A timeline was set to finalize internal recommendations on the NCL actions. This allows for the formal voting process to occur distinctly for the Foundation's roles: first as an ICC member, followed by voting as a DRep. Emphasis was placed on the need to coordinate internal workflows (involving legal, communications, and executive committee approval) and to ensure external communications accurately reflect the final voting decisions and rationales, avoiding conflicting messages. Plans were also made to clarify task separation between team members involved in related communications efforts.
