title: "ICC Governance Meeting - 09 April 2025"
date: "2025-04-09"
summary: "The meeting covered the status and voting strategy for two Net Change Limit governance actions, noting potential challenges in reaching the required 50%+1 approval threshold due to DRep participation levels. Deliberations also addressed the high 67% threshold for Treasury Withdrawal actions, the unclear process following budget approval, and concerns regarding DRep voting engagement. Discussions included the technical feasibility of using GovTool for DRep voting and the complexities of creating a standardized assessment framework for diverse budget proposals, considering alignment with the Cardano roadmap and potential funding ceilings. Next steps involve finalizing votes on the Net Change Limits, associated communications to encourage DRep participation, testing GovTool compatibility, and refining an internal approach for assessing budget proposals."

## Summary  

The meeting covered the status and voting strategy for two Net Change Limit governance actions, noting potential challenges in reaching the required 50%+1 approval threshold due to DRep participation levels. Deliberations also addressed the high 67% threshold for Treasury Withdrawal actions, the unclear process following budget approval, and concerns regarding DRep voting engagement. Discussions included the technical feasibility of using GovTool for DRep voting and the complexities of creating a standardized assessment framework for diverse budget proposals, considering alignment with the Cardano roadmap and potential funding ceilings. Next steps involve finalizing votes on the Net Change Limits, associated communications to encourage DRep participation, testing GovTool compatibility, and refining an internal approach for assessing budget proposals.

## Details  

### Net Change Limit Governance Actions

The status of two Net Change Limit governance actions was reviewed. For the first action, the decision was to vote 'Yes' as an ICC member (deeming it constitutional) but 'No' as a DRep, with rationale to be provided. For the second action, the decision was to vote 'Yes' from both ICC and DRep perspectives. Both actions required a 50%+1 DRep approval threshold and were currently at 26% approval. Concerns were raised about achieving the threshold, but it was noted that many DReps voted late, and a 'Yes' vote from the Foundation could send a positive signal. The importance of communicating these votes and encouraging wider DRep participation was emphasized.

### Treasury Withdrawal Governance Actions & Timeline

The significant risk associated with the high 67% approval threshold required for Treasury Withdrawal governance actions was discussed. Uncertainty remains regarding the process for submitting withdrawal requests after a budget's approval, specifically concerning the roles of the proposer and administrator, which are not explicitly defined in the constitution. It was clarified that failure to pass the Net Change Limits would block the entire budget process. Once a budget (submitted as an info action, also requiring 50%+1 approval according to constitutional guardrail TREASURY-04a) is approved, any submitted treasury withdrawal that builds on said budget is, unlike info actions, checked for ratification at each epoch boundary during its lifetime; if the 67% DRep and CC thresholds are met at any epoch boundary, the payout occurs in the following epoch when the action is enacted.

### DRep Voting Participation

Concerns were discussed regarding the likelihood of Net Change Limit actions passing, not necessarily due to 'No' votes, but due to insufficient participation from active DReps. Non-participation by active DReps effectively counts against reaching the required threshold. Comparisons were drawn to past actions, noting the New Constitution achieved above 75% approval, while a previous parameter change failed. The need for community communication to encourage voting was agreed upon.

### GovTool Voting & Budget Proposal Assessment

The process for DReps to upvote/downvote budget proposals on the GovTool was outlined, requiring wallet registration and connection. Technical challenges were noted, including potential incompatibility for DReps who registered via cardano-cli and issues reported with hardware wallets. A need was identified to test the compatibility of the Foundation's DRep setup and establish an internal process for voting on GovTool proposals, potentially designating one person to vote on behalf of the group.

### Budget Proposal Assessment Framework

Significant deliberation occurred regarding the creation of a framework for assessing the wide variety of budget proposals submitted via the GovTool. The challenge lies in comparing vastly different proposals (e.g., tool features, large budgets, local meetups) using a single framework. The discussion shifted towards defining an internal assessment scope, focusing on alignment with the Cardano vision/roadmap (previously approved by DReps), ecosystem principles from “Our Cardano,” and considering high-impact proposals outside this scope. Filtering proposals based on whether they belong in Project Catalyst versus the Intersect budget info action was deemed difficult due to overlap and the evolving nature of Catalyst and the bugdet process. A potential financial ceiling for endorsed proposals (e.g., 50% of the Net Change Limit) was considered to ensure room for multiple budgets, as outlined in the constitution.
