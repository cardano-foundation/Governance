## Summary  

Discussions covered the status of Net Change Limit actions, differing ICC rationales regarding constitutional interpretations, and community concerns about ICC voting patterns. Key deliberations included potential CC re-election for the Foundation, offering mentorship to governance action proposers, the challenge of unified CC action, and future constitutional amendments targeting ambiguities, guardrails, and process simplification, acknowledging the associated complexities.

## Details  

### Net Change Limit Governance Actions Status

The team reviewed the two active Net Change Limit governance actions. The first action, expiring April 19th, stood at 30% DRep approval and was considered unlikely to pass, partly due to recent 'No' votes from large DReps and differing constitutionality assessments from other ICC members. The second action, expiring April 24th, had risen to 36% DRep approval. Its success was deemed dependent on pending votes from several large DReps, including Emergo, whose combined voting power could significantly impact the outcome. Optimism remained that the required >50% threshold could be met.

### ICC Voting Rationales & Community Perception

Discussion occurred regarding the rationales provided by other ICC members for deeming the first Net Change Limit action unconstitutional. The primary reason cited was the proposal's self-imposed 67% ratification threshold, which some ICC members interpreted as violating the constitution's minimum requirement of >50%. This interpretation was debated, with concerns raised that such precedents could create future inconsistencies in decision-making. It was also reported that criticism exists within the community regarding the current ICC's voting frequency and perceived unpredictability.

### Constitutional Committee Re-election

In light of upcoming CC elections and community discussions about the current ICC, the team deliberated on whether the Foundation should seek re-election. The prevailing view, reflecting prior Executive Committee discussions, was to assess the quality and sufficiency of other candidates who emerge before making a final decision. The Foundation might consider running again if the candidate pool is deemed inadequate to safeguard the CC's function, emphasizing the demanding nature of the role if taken seriously.

### Mentorship for Governance Action Proposers

A suggestion was made to offer support or mentorship to community members proposing governance actions. This could involve helping structure proposals, gathering supporting data, and refining rationales to increase the likelihood of meeting constitutional requirements and gaining DRep support. While acknowledging this wouldn't guarantee success, especially given differing interpretations among ICC members, it was seen as a way to clarify the Foundation's stance, supporting sound ideas while ensuring proper process and justification, rather than simply blocking proposals based on execution flaws. This aligns with sentiments already expressed in the Foundation's voting rationales.

### Constitutional Amendments & Process

The conversation touched upon the need for constitutional amendments to address ambiguities (like the interpretation of ratification thresholds) that lead to differing ICC interpretations and community frustration. Plans were shared regarding ongoing work to propose initial, less controversial amendments ("low-hanging fruit") around mid-May, aiming to familiarize the community with the constitutional amendment process. More substantial changes, such as removing or revising the protocol parameter guardrails (a point of contention highlighted during a recent workshop), were also discussed as potential future amendments. The complexities of the amendment process were acknowledged, including the high 75% DRep approval threshold and the technical possibilities (and potential confusion) of chaining multiple amendments. A strategy of proposing smaller, iterative changes was favored to improve DRep comprehension and likelihood of passage, contrasting with more centralized, process-heavy approaches suggested elsewhere.
