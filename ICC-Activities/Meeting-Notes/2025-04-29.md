## Summary  

The meeting addressed a new 200 million ada Net Change Limit (NCL) action and the implications of frequent NCL changes. Deliberations covered Ekklesia tool budget proposal status (especially Intersect's opposition), upcoming reconciliation workshops, publishing Foundation votes/rationales despite tool limitations, and defining DRep delegation withdrawal criteria. Actions include reviewing the new NCL, publishing key rationales, and refining delegation guardrails.

## Details  

### New Net Change Limit (200M ADA) Review

A new governance action proposing a Net Change Limit of 200M ADA for the remainder of 2025 was introduced, submitted shortly after the previous 350M ADA limit was approved. This new proposal, active until May 29th, had already garnered 15% DRep approval. The advisory team will review its constitutionality and assess it from a DRep perspective, with recommendations to be discussed in the following meeting.

### Concerns Regarding Net Change Limit Frequency

The submission of another NCL action so soon after the previous one was approved sparked discussion about the potential negative consequences of frequent changes. Concerns were raised that constantly adjusting the NCL undermines predictability, which is crucial for ecosystem stability and attracting enterprise adoption. It was compared to continuously changing budget parameters within an organization, leading to inefficiency and inability to deliver. While the current system allows NCL changes anytime, the potential for creating a precedent of frequent updates was viewed as potentially dangerous. The need for a more stable approach, potentially treating the NCL like critical protocol parameters with update limitations via constitutional amendment, was implicitly raised.

### Ekklesia Tool Voting & Intersect Proposal Status

The team discussed the voting results emerging from the Ekklesia tool for various budget proposals. The calculation of the 50% approval threshold based on participating stake (estimated around 2 billion ADA at the time of the meeting) without a formal quorum was noted. Specific attention was given to the Intersect budget proposal, which showed significant opposition (approx. 1.7B ADA voting 'No' vs. 422M ADA voting 'Yes'). This raised concerns because many other proposals rely on Intersect as their listed administrator; if Intersect's own budget fails, it could invalidate or complicate those dependent proposals, potentially resetting parts of the budget process.

### Budget Reconciliation Process

The upcoming process for finalizing the Intersect budget governance action(s) was outlined. Based on the Ekklesia tool results, an initial budget info governance action will be formulated. Proposals not making the initial cut (like potentially Intersect) could be discussed in subsequent workshops, allowing proposers time to address DRep concerns and potentially be included in a later governance action. This iterative process involves DRep feedback and potential conditional 'No' votes intended to guide proposal improvements.

### Publication of CF Votes and Rationales

Given the current inability to vote directly in the Ekklesia tool due to technical issues (potential multi-sig incompatibility), the team discussed the urgent need to publicly communicate the Foundation's stance on the various budget proposals. An internal spreadsheet tracks the assessment and proposed vote (Yes/No/Abstain) for each. Key proposals like Intersect and the Input Output budget required final decisions (leaning towards Abstain for consistency, linking to prior feedback given via forum posts). The challenge was preparing and publishing rationales for potentially numerous proposals by a target of Thursday. A pragmatic approach was favored: focusing detailed, carefully worded rationales on high-value proposals (e.g., >3M ADA) and using standardized, high-level rationale categories (based on the previously published assessment framework) for smaller ones, rather than publishing potentially inconsistent or rushed individual comments for all.
