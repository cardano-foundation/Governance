title: "ICC Governance Meeting - 07 May 2025"
date: "2025-05-07"
summary: "The team discussed four new governance actions: two proposing Net Change Limits (NCL) of 200M and 300M ada, and two for ecosystem budgets (Rust node Amaru and a DeFi liquidity proposal with a submission error). Deliberations focused on the constitutionality and DRep perspective for the 200M NCL, with arguments presented for both lower and existing limits, considering impacts on major budget holders like IOG and the need for ecosystem spending versus predictability. The lack of rationale in NCL proposals for changing existing limits was noted. Concerns were also raised about potential conflicts of interest regarding the DeFi proposal, leading to a discussion on abstention. The team was urged to submit voting recommendations for all active governance actions, prioritizing the 200M NCL."

## Summary  

The team discussed four new governance actions: two proposing Net Change Limits (NCL) of 200M and 300M ada, and two for ecosystem budgets (Rust node Amaru and a DeFi liquidity proposal with a submission error). Deliberations focused on the constitutionality and DRep perspective for the 200M NCL, with arguments presented for both lower and existing limits, considering impacts on major budget holders like IOG and the need for ecosystem spending versus predictability. The lack of rationale in NCL proposals for changing existing limits was noted. Concerns were also raised about potential conflicts of interest regarding the DeFi proposal, leading to a discussion on abstention. The team was urged to submit voting recommendations for all active governance actions, prioritizing the 200M NCL.

## Details  

### New Governance Actions Overview

Four governance actions were active: two proposing NCLs for 2025 (200M ada expiring May 29th, and a newer 300M ada expiring June 8th), an Amaru budget proposal to fund the development of an alternative block-producing client in Rust (1.5M ada), and a DeFi liquidity boosting proposal (50M ada) which had a metadata hash mismatch. The upcoming Intersect budget proposal was also anticipated, potentially bringing the total concurrent actions to five or more.

### Net Change Limit Proposals (200M & 300M ada)

The 200M ADA NCL proposal was at 23.7% DRep approval. A discussion arose regarding a constitutional loophole: the NCL explicitly limits treasury withdrawals but not necessarily budget approvals, meaning a budget could theoretically be approved exceeding the NCL, though withdrawals would still be capped. The initial establishment of the 350M NCL was criticised for not offering DReps multiple choices simultaneously; however, the practicality of multiple concurrent NCL proposals achieving the >50% threshold was questioned. A key concern raised was the lack of sufficient rationale in new NCL proposals explaining why the existing NCL is inadequate or why the new proposed limit is better.

### Deliberation on 200M ada Net Change Limit

From a DRep perspective, arguments were made against supporting the 200M NCL, citing potential negative consequences and disruption. Conversely, arguments in favor suggested a lower NCL could pressure large entities to reduce budget requests, especially given community concerns about their delivery capabilities. This view considered that a lower NCL might force a more critical look at spending. However, counterpoints highlighted the lengthy budget allocation timelines and questioned if entities would indeed reduce requests, emphasizing the ecosystem's need to spend for growth and to catch up, and that changing the NCL now creates uncertainty.

### Budget Review Process and Specific Proposal Concerns

The recent Intersect budget review process was acknowledged. The general difficulty in judging the suitability of many budget proposals for the Cardano treasury versus Project Catalyst was reiterated. The challenge of conducting thorough due diligence on all proposing entities, especially with increasing volume, was highlighted, suggesting that the most critical checks should occur at the treasury withdrawal stage or by the administrator. Intersect is reportedly planning one budget info action for all its ~40 approved proposals.

### Voting Recommendations for Other Governance Actions

For the DeFi liquidity boosting proposal, a recommendation to abstain from voting (both as ICC and potentially as DRep) was made due to a potential conflict of interest involving a team member. For the Amaru proposal, abstention was also floated as a consideration. Governance Advisory Team members were urged to submit their voting recommendations for all active governance actions, with a deadline for the 200M NCL proposal by the end of the week to allow for timely voting after an upcoming event.
