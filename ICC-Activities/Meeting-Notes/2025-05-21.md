title: "ICC Governance Meeting - 21 May 2025"
date: "2025-05-21"
summary: "The meeting addressed six active governance actions, with a primary focus on the 200 million ada Net Change Limit (NCL) proposal, which was nearing its expiry, currently at 41% DRep approval. Discussions covered its constitutionality (deemed constitutional by all reviewers despite minor wording issues), the Foundation's DRep stance (leaning towards voting against due to stability concerns), and broader implications of NCL changes on budget processes and treasury withdrawals. Other actions reviewed included a DeFi liquidity proposal (with a notable hash mismatch, though the interpretation was debated), the Amaru budget proposal, and an Ecosystem Builder proposal. The team also discussed potential conflicts of interest in voting on proposals where members have involvement, the upcoming Constitutional Committee (CC) elections (noting a low number of current applicants), and the Foundation's potential role if the candidate pool remains insufficient."

## Summary  

The meeting addressed six active governance actions, with a primary focus on the 200 million ada Net Change Limit (NCL) proposal, which was nearing its expiry, currently at 41% DRep approval. Discussions covered its constitutionality (deemed constitutional by all reviewers despite minor wording issues), the Foundation's DRep stance (leaning towards voting against due to stability concerns), and broader implications of NCL changes on budget processes and treasury withdrawals. Other actions reviewed included a DeFi liquidity proposal (with a notable hash mismatch, though the interpretation was debated), the Amaru budget proposal, and an Ecosystem Builder proposal. The team also discussed potential conflicts of interest in voting on proposals where members have involvement, the upcoming Constitutional Committee (CC) elections (noting a low number of current applicants), and the Foundation's potential role if the candidate pool remains insufficient.

## Details  

### 200M ada Net Change Limit (NCL) Status and Constitutionality

The 200M ada NCL proposal, expiring May 29th, currently had 41% DRep approval, short of the >50% required. All advisors deemed the action constitutional, with only a minor point of confusion regarding the phrasing of the "greater than 50%" threshold. The Foundation's DRep recommendation was leaning towards voting 'No', primarily arguing that lowering the NCL so soon after a previous one was approved contradicts principles of stability and predictability for the ecosystem. It was suggested that for future NCL setting (e.g., for 2026), a more comprehensive approach allowing DReps to choose from multiple proposed values presented via info actions simultaneously would be preferable.

### NCL, Budget Info Actions, and Treasury Withdrawals

A clarification was made that, according to the current constitution, budget info actions (BIAs) are not explicitly dependent on an approved NCL; only treasury withdrawals are directly restricted by it. However, a common misconception ties them closely, influencing DRep perceptions. The potential for a constitutional amendment to remove the NCL entirely was briefly discussed, with the argument that DReps themselves could act as a "human NCL." Concerns were raised by some members about how a lower NCL would impact multi-year projects and where budget cuts would fall, especially if Intersect proceeds with a large omnibus withdrawal request. It was noted that Intersect is considering how to structure withdrawals, potentially batching them based on support levels.

### DeFi Liquidity Proposal - Hash Mismatch

A DeFi liquidity BIA was identified as having a hash mismatch between its metadata and anchor URL. The initial assessment was that this rendered it unconstitutional. However, a counter-argument was presented that the mismatch might be due to a minor tooling issue (e.g., an extra line feed) rather than malicious intent, and that the constitution doesn't explicitly define the hashing algorithm or mandate an exact match if the content's integrity can be verified. This led to a discussion on the flexibility of CC interpretation versus strict adherence to technicalities, suggesting that such issues might warrant future constitutional clarification.

### Amaru BIA and Voting Conflicts of Interest

The Amaru BIA, which had seen a significant increase in DRep approval, was reviewed for constitutionality. This prompted a broader discussion on how the Foundation should handle voting on proposals where its members or the organization itself has direct or indirect involvement. It was generally agreed that from an ICC perspective, assessing constitutionality should remain objective. From a DRep perspective, opinions varied: some argued for abstaining to avoid perceived conflicts (especially if individuals within the advisory team are directly involved in the proposal's scope or budget), while others contended that supporting initiatives the Foundation is part of (even tangentially) demonstrates confidence and is comparable to political entities supporting their own platforms. The need to document a consistent internal process for these situations was identified.

### Constitutional Committee (CC) Elections

An update on the CC elections revealed a low number of applications (five identified) for the seven available seats, which was a point of concern. It was noted that several existing councils (Atlantic, Eastern, likely Japan) plan to run again. The Foundation's internal policy is that if the CF runs for the CC, employees should withdraw from competing council applications. The team reiterated the Foundation's stance: it would consider running if the candidate pool is deemed insufficient to ensure the integrity and proper functioning of Cardano's governance, but would prefer strong independent candidates to emerge. The application process itself, requiring demonstration of governance action review capabilities, was seen as a positive filter.
