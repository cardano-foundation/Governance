## Summary  

The meeting addressed the status of various governance actions. Discussions included the Amaru budget info action, which presented differing recommendations and prompted discussion on potential conflicts of interest. Challenges related to budget proposal structuring, treasury withdrawal logistics, and a metadata mismatch in the DeFi liquidity proposal were also examined. Other topics included Community Builders’ ecosystem budget proposal and broader complexities within the budgeting process.

## Details  

### Governance Actions Overview

An update was provided on the progress of ongoing governance actions. The vote on the 200 million ada net change limit governance action did not achieve the required approval threshold yet. Reviews are currently underway for the 300M ada NCL and four budget info actions: Amaru, DeFi liquidity, Community Builders’ budget, and Intersect budget.

### Amaru DRep Rationale and Conflicts of Interest

Discussions on the Amaru budget info action from the CF DRep perspective revealed differing recommendations. Arguments for a 'Yes' vote cited transparency regarding Foundation employee involvement in the Amaru maintainer committee and the importance of ecosystem participation. Conversely, arguments for an 'Abstain' vote posited that Foundation personnel support constitutes implicit approval, allowing for independent community decision-making given the Foundation's voting power. The strategic importance of the alternate node for the Cardano ecosystem's resilience was also highlighted. The broader topic of potential conflicts of interest when the Foundation votes on proposals involving its own initiatives or personnel was also discussed.

### Budget Proposal Bucketing and Treasury Withdrawal Logistics

Discussions included the possibility of grouping treasury withdrawal actions based on voting support within Ekklesia, particularly for event-driven proposals requiring upfront funding. Concerns were raised regarding the uncertainty surrounding the number of future treasury withdrawal actions and the logistical challenges of assisting Intersect with the ada deposit requirements for numerous withdrawals. The idea of chunking withdrawals by amount was considered, though concerns about this approach were also noted. The plan for a smart contract to manage budget payouts was discussed, clarifying that while it offers an audit trail, it does not strictly control fund disbursement. 

### DeFi Liquidity Proposal - Metadata Mismatch

The DeFi liquidity proposal was identified as having a mismatch between its metadata and anchor URL. This was considered a constitutional violation by some. Arguments suggested the mismatch stemmed from a common tooling problem, allowing for easy hash reconstruction and indicating an honest error rather than malicious intent. Concerns were expressed about the recurring nature of such errors, questioning the lack of basic checks in the tooling. The DeFi liquidity proposal is expected to be resubmitted. A distinction was drawn between a constitutional and moral issue, with a personal inclination towards acceptance due to the honest mistake despite its clear constitutional violation.

### Ecosystem Budget Proposal and Budgeting Process Concerns

Community Builders’ budget proposal was introduced. Review of this proposal and the Intersect budget by all team members was pending due to the high volume of governance actions. Initial opinions on the 7.5 million ada proposal focused on its constitutional aspects rather than tactical feasibility or economic sense, supporting it as offering a more granular voting option. The question of whether a designated administrator needs to provide consent at the budget proposal stage was raised. Potential conflicts and complexities arising from overlapping budget proposals and different administrators for the same projects were highlighted. The complexities and potential issues inherent in the current budget proposal system, including the need for careful tracking and coordination, were acknowledged.
