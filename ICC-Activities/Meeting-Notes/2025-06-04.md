## Summary  

The meeting on June 4th provided updates on several live governance actions, including expiring budgets for Amaru, Community builders, and DeFi liquidity. A significant portion of the discussion focused on 7.5 million ada budget proposal, addressing concerns regarding its clarity, process, and implications, which led to a thorough discussion but resulted in a tentative recommendation for approval. The team also discussed the Intersect budget info action, with concerns raised about data verification and the concept of an omnibus treasury withdrawal. A simpler approach with few withdrawals was advocated, and the importance of DRep diligence was emphasized.

## Details  

### Live Governance Actions Update

Updates were provided on five live governance actions. The 200 million ada net change limit did not pass the approval threshold. The Amaru budget, community builders budget (7.5 million ada), 300 million ada net change limit, and DeFi liquidity budget are nearing expiry. The Cardano Foundation has voted on some of these, and the vote on the 7.5 million ada budget proposal requires finalization, with a current split among voters.

### Discussion on the 7.5 Million ADA Budget Proposal

7.5 million ada budget proposal was discussed. It includes seven Ekklesia-approved proposals that met the 67% mainnet approval threshold. Concerns were raised regarding the proposal's articulation, lack of clarity on proposers' relationship with projects, and agreement for inclusion. Initial inclinations to vote 'No' were based on the assumption of Intersect administering the budget without explicit confirmation, lack of auditing information, and overall proposal quality. Conversely, arguments for consideration cited the content's benefit to community projects and Intersect's previous offer to administer budgets. A 'No' vote was cast by some due to potential redundancies with Intersect's budget breakdowns and lack of prior communication, and a perceived political statement in the approach. Note: After the meeting it was discovered that Starstream, one of the seven proposals, has indicated that they would not want Intersect to administer their budget proposal.

### Intersect Governance Action Budget Discussion

Discussion commenced on the Intersect budget info action, expiring on June 13th, which appears constitutional. The primary discussion point was the CF DRep perspective, considering numerous abstentions or 'No' votes on high-ticket proposals during the reconciliation process on Ekklesia. Some team members indicated a 'Yes' vote on the budget info action due to urgency, but with strong conditions for the upcoming treasury withdrawal. Significant problems were expressed with the Intersect proposal due to difficulty in verifying provided information, despite trusting the Ekklesia process. The lack of sufficient data was also noted as a potential constitutionality issue.

### Concerns Regarding Omnibus Treasury Withdrawal

A clear stance was suggested against supporting a single omnibus treasury withdrawal. Agreement was reached on not wanting to paralyze the process and addressing concerns during individual withdrawals, noting it is easier to block a withdrawal than an info action.

### Arguments for a Simpler Approach

A simpler approach with fewer withdrawals was advocated to reduce workload, suggesting evaluation and improvement over time. It was clarified that voting on the Intersect budget this week was not possible due to the time required to review the proposals within it.

### Importance of DRep Diligence

The importance of DReps not voting solely based on external influence was emphasized. The current lack of incentive for voting and the difficulty of passing multiple individual withdrawals were noted.
