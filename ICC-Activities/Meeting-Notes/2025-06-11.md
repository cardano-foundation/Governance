## Summary  

The Governance Advisory Team meeting on June 11th addressed updates on various governance actions and treasury withdrawals, including the status of several DRep votes and the potential for 39 separate treasury withdrawal proposals. Discussions covered proposed constitution amendments, concerns regarding a new constitution draft, and the upcoming Constitutional Committee (CC) election process, encompassing the voting tool and candidate recommendation procedures, even without a guarantee that we can technically vote. A change in the governance advisory team's DRep representation was announced, and strategies for managing numerous treasury withdrawal proposals and Intersect's voting plans were deliberated.

## Details  

### Governance Actions Update

Most live governance actions have been successfully voted on, with the Intersect budget info action still being finalized. Recent DRep votes resulted in rejections for the 300 million ada net change limit, the DeFi liquidity budget proposal, and the 7.5 million ada Cardano blockchain ecosystem budget. The Amaru budget proposal was approved. The 7.5 million ada Cardano blockchain ecosystem budget was also deemed unconstitutional by the ICC members.

### Intersect Budget Info Action & Treasury Withdrawals

The Intersect budget info action has received over 50% approval and is unlikely to drop below this threshold before its June 13th expiry. The rationale for the ICC vote is approved, and the DRep rationale is in progress. A poll on Ekklesia indicated that the 39-proposal option for treasury withdrawals received the most votes, suggesting these will proceed, likely in tranches. 

### Constitution Amendments Discussion

Inquiries were made about discussing constitution amendments. Yuta's new constitution initiative was also raised. Discussions with Yuta are planned, acknowledging that significant changes would likely fail without broader socialization. 

### CC Voting Process

The CC election voting, run by Intersect, is scheduled to start on June 12th and conclude on July 2nd. Questions arose regarding the voting platform and accessibility for DReps with multi-sig wallets. Efforts are underway to determine voting tool availability. A spreadsheet was created to gather team recommendations on 19 candidates, categorized by rating, to produce a final ranking for Executive Committee approval, dependent on DRep voting being enabled in Gov tools. Note: After the meeting it was determined that DReps that leverage a native script multi-sig setup can vote.

#### Decision on Voting Without Tool Access

The question of proceeding with recommendations if no voting tool is available for CF was raised. Opinions were sought on rating candidates and providing a recommendation even without the ability to cast votes. Some suggested waiting for clarity on voting access before deciding on a recommendation process. A majority agreed to release recommendations regardless of voting tool availability.

#### Considerations for CC Candidates

Candidates that are employed by CF will recuse themselves from CF assessment (Nicolas Cerny and Matthias Benkort). Discussion initiated on potential exclusion criteria for candidates, such as simultaneous DRep and CC candidacy, and the motivations of consortiums or entities running for both. It was not seen as an issue, provided the separation of powers is acknowledged. The importance of sharing evaluation criteriawhen releasing recommendations was raised.

#### Discussion on Voting for CF-Affiliated CC Candidates

Communications concerns were raised regarding the perception of the Cardano Foundation supporting its own members in an independent election. The team acknowledged the trade-offs and decided to proceed with the evaluation.

### Intersect Treasury Withdrawals and Voting Strategy

The challenge of managing potentially 39 treasury withdrawal proposals was raised. Inquiries were made about Intersect's plan for treasury withdrawals, specifically whether it would be five or ten withdrawals per epoch over approximately eight epochs. Regarding voting, it was suggested that if Ekklesia previously decided to vote 'No' or 'Abstain' on a proposal and no fundamental changes had occurred, that decision should be adhered to. The need to create template rationales for the ICC to assess the constitutionality of treasury withdrawals and for the DRep side was identified, acknowledging that the voting process will be challenging.
