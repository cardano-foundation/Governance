## Summary  

The Governance Advisory Team meeting on June 18th included updates on the ongoing Constitutional Committee (CC) election and concern on the Eastern Cardano Council member. Discussions centered on the upcoming 39 treasury withdrawal proposals from Intersect Budget Info Action, highlighting associated complexities and communication challenges. The team also addressed improving the efficiency of reviewing treasury proposals and the need for a proactive approach to planning future budget processes, with other upcoming governance actions also mentioned.

## Details  

### Constitutional Committee Election Recap  

A recap was provided on the ongoing off-chain election facilitated by Intersect to determine the next seven constitutional committee members. Credentials will be submitted via an on-chain governance action around late July or early August, prior to the current ICC members' term expiring on September 1st, 2025. DRep engagement in the current election is initially low, with the election continuing until July 2nd. The Cardano Foundation DRep will vote based on an assessment framework, a related blog post on the framework is being finalized and will be shared with the community.

### Allegations Regarding Eastern Cardano Council Member  

Concerns were raised about an Eastern Cardano Council (ECC) member, who was accused of being a stake pool operator without disclosure, potentially creating a conflict of interest. While the significance of undisclosed SPO status was debated, the team emphasized checks and balances and avoiding power concentration. Awaiting the accused member's statement, and noting other ECC members are aware, the team will take no immediate action on these unverified claims.

### Efficiency in Reviewing Treasury Proposals  

The impracticality of reviewing all 39 treasury proposals with the same level of scrutiny as regular governance actions was highlighted. To enhance efficiency, Intersect will provide a template for treasury withdrawal metadata, enabling an initial constitutional assessment from the ICC perspective. For the DRep vote, the team will adhere to their [Ekklesia budget voting](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_pNnMcZyLBod_1gGw21-RT7332BdVcrtorWi2vsF44A/edit?gid=0#gid=0), as no significant changes to the proposals (except Intersect's cost reduction) have occurred since the Ekklesia vote. Despite this, checks will still be conducted. Yuta's (DRep) intention to vote 'No' on some proposals, including those involving the Foundation, was noted. The current vendor-led budget process was reiterated as flawed. From the ICC perspective, the focus should be on verifying if treasury withdrawal proposals match approved budget proposals and if DRep votes align with their Ekklesia decisions. It was suggested that future budgets should be broader, with details and milestones disclosed at the treasury withdrawal stage.

### Future Budget Process Discussions  

Discussions about plans for the next year's budget process, including early random actions and budget committee discussions, were initiated. [Feedback from March](https://cdck-file-uploads-us1.s3.dualstack.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flex023/uploads/cardano/original/3X/0/c/0c0c559ab994e5e85ba6624b389ea8f406789dd4.pdf) included recommendations for a future budget process. It was suggested that the Foundation should proactively present a concrete plan or proposals for changes to the budget process before the RareEvo conference. This would enable team members attending RareEvo to advocate for these ideas. A discussion with internal SMEs is planned to collaboratively create an extensive blog post covering a retrospective of the current budget process and future recommendations.

### Upcoming Governance Actions  

Upcoming governance actions beyond the 39 individual proposals include the Amaru (rust node) Treasury withdrawal and the DeFi liquidity budget info action. The DeFi liquidity budget proposal, involving several individuals, was delayed due to recent discussions around a Cardano wealth fund idea and will be resubmitted later. The Amaru treasury withdrawal is still being tested on preview, with submission hoped for by week-end. Complexities of coordinating operations requiring authorization from all scope owners were explained. Submitting the proposal early in the epoch was advised. Concerns were expressed about potential errors in the treasury contract setup rather than the proposal passing. Risks associated with using smart contracts for budget management, given current tooling and ecosystem state, were highlighted, including the possibility of permanently locking funds due to manual and error-prone processes. The lack of user-friendly interfaces and the substantial funds involved in the main test run were noted. Concerns were echoed that end-users proposing and receiving funds have not practiced with the system. While smart contracts have been audited and are being tested for Amaru, the end-user experience remains untested. It was clarified that Catalyst funds are disbursed via custodial addresses, not the new smart contract mechanism, and early Catalyst rounds used MIR certificates for direct treasury disbursements, transitioning to custodial addresses for efficiency. It was recalled that Intersect previously indicated they would not use smart contracts for everything due to novelty and risk but have apparently changed course.
