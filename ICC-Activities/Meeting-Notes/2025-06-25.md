title: "ICC Governance Meeting - 25 June 2025"
date: "2025-06-25"
summary: "The meeting covered critical updates on governance processes, beginning with the Constitutional Committee (CC) election voting, where a technical issue is jeopardizing the ability for script-based wallets to vote, though a fix is actively being pursued. The team discussed the rationale for the current off-chain pre-vote process for the CC election, noting it was an Intersect-defined off-chain process ahead of the formal on-chain vote required by the constitution and protocol. A newly submitted treasury withdrawal for the Amaru rust node was presented for review, with confirmation that its on-chain and off-chain data align and that an audit report is available for verification. In anticipation of 39 separate treasury withdrawal proposals from Intersect, the team agreed on a strategy to streamline the review process by using a standardized spreadsheet and template rationales for both ICC and DRep."

## Summary  

The meeting covered critical updates on governance processes, beginning with the Constitutional Committee (CC) election voting, where a technical issue is jeopardizing the ability for script-based wallets to vote, though a fix is actively being pursued. The team discussed the rationale for the current off-chain pre-vote process for the CC election, noting it was an Intersect-defined off-chain process ahead of the formal on-chain vote required by the constitution and protocol. A newly submitted treasury withdrawal for the Amaru rust node was presented for review, with confirmation that its on-chain and off-chain data align and that an audit report is available for verification. In anticipation of 39 separate treasury withdrawal proposals from Intersect, the team agreed on a strategy to streamline the review process by using a standardized spreadsheet and template rationales for both ICC and DRep.

## Details  

### Constitutional Committee (CC) Election Voting Process

An update was provided on the technical status of the CC election voting, which is currently at risk. The issue stems from the voting tool's implementation of CIP-8 signing, which is incompatible with the Foundation's script-based multi-sig DRep. Efforts are underway to implement a solution that attaches metadata to a transaction, which can then be signed by the script. This was the originally intended method but was altered due to a miscommunication. A brief discussion was held on whether to delay a planned blog post about the Foundation's voting recommendations until the technical issue is resolved. Some members felt it was prudent to wait for confirmation that a vote could be cast, while others argued the recommendations could be published regardless of the final technical outcome.

### Rationale for Off-Chain Pre-Vote in CC Election

A query was raised regarding why the current CC election vote is being conducted off-chain via a "pre-vote" in a third-party tool rather than directly on-chain. It was clarified that this process was defined by Intersect as a method for CC credential discovery before the formal on-chain governance action. The constitution requires a process for CC elections (Art. VII, Sec. VII) but does not explicitly forbid this preliminary step. However, concerns were noted regarding how the broader community, particularly DReps and SPOs, will perceive the legitimacy of this off-chain phase, as their on-chain approval (67% for DReps, 51% for SPOs) is still required to finalize the new committee.

### Amaru Treasury Withdrawal Review

The team was notified that a treasury withdrawal governance action for the Amaru rust node had been submitted. The initial constitutional checks confirmed that the on-chain payout details (script hashes and amounts) are identical to the off-chain metadata, and a comprehensive audit report from TxPipe detailing the smart contract setup is available for review. This provides a clear path for verification. It was agreed that the DRep voting stance would remain consistent with the 'Yes' vote on the prior budget info action for Amaru, as no substantive changes to the proposal have been made.

### Strategy for Upcoming Intersect Treasury Withdrawals

In anticipation of receiving 39 distinct treasury withdrawal proposals from Intersect, the team discussed and agreed upon a strategy to manage the significant review workload. Instead of tracking each proposal individually on the team's standard Jira project board, a dedicated spreadsheet will be used, similar to the process for the Ekklesia budget assessments. Furthermore, a template-based approach will be developed for drafting both the ICC constitutionality rationales and the DRep voting rationales. This will ensure consistency and efficiency in processing the large volume of related, yet separate, governance actions.
