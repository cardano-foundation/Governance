## Summary  

The Governance Advisory Team meeting on July 2nd included updates on the Amaru Treasury withdrawal governance action, which currently stands at 38% approval. An update on the off-chain Constitutional Committee (CC) election, concluding today, noted the requirement for CC credentials to be provided by July 8th. Concerns were raised regarding the metadata template for the 39 upcoming Treasury withdrawal governance actions. Discussions focused on the efficiency of using a single voting rationale for all 39 treasury withdrawals and the need for a checklist to review material differences between proposals and treasury withdrawals metadata.

## Details  

### Amaru Treasury Withdrawal Governance Action

An update was provided on the Treasury Withdrawal Governance Action, currently at 38% approval, with 67% required from the active voting stake of DReps. The constitutional review found no unconstitutional aspects at the time of the meeting. 

### CC Election and Credentials

The off-chain CC election, facilitated by Intersect, is concluding on July 2nd, with results anticipated on July 6th. Intersect has requested all applicants provide their CC credentials by July 8th, which was understood as a measure for planning against delays. The existing ICC will continue its work until its term expires, with new credentials likely being added to existing ones on-chain.

### Voting Logistics for 39 Treasury Withdrawal Proposals

Discussions addressed the logistics for voting on 39 individual Treasury withdrawal proposals, highlighting concerns regarding the metadata template Intersect intends to use. Doubts were expressed that the template would be ready by July 8th. It was highlighted that some of the contracts between the Cardano Development Holding (CDH) and vendors were not yet finalized, preventing immediate linking of those contracts to the metadata, and therefore delaying the governance action until completion would be impractical.

#### Discrepancies Between Treasury Withdrawals and Approved Budgets

A concern was raised that  if rephrasing or simplifying the content of treasury withdrawals were to occur, this could result in discrepancies  when compared to the original detailed budget proposals. Such changes would necessitate additional checks to ensure alignment with previously approved budgets. It was suggested to focus on essential elements like purpose, amount, vendor, and substantial delivery, rather than minor rephrasing. A checklist would be created to ensure all proposals pass the procedural requirements.

#### Unified Voting Rationale for 39 Proposals

A proposal was made to utilize a single voting rationale for all 39 proposals from both the ICC and DRep perspectives. This approach aims to reduce error likelihood and enhance operational efficiency compared to drafting 39 individual rationales. The practicality of a single document for assessment and cross-checking was emphasized, while still allowing for referencing specific points. It was clarified that even if a specific proposal were deemed unconstitutional, this information could still be included within the single rationale.

### CF DRep Profile Update

A request was made for the Communications team to propose the CF DRep metadata change, leveraging the opportunity presented during the Constitutional Committee voting. It was suggested to use this chance to add a useful description, as the current metadata only contains two links to "Our Cardano".
