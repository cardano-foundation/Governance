## Summary  

The Governance Advisory Team meeting on July 9th included updates on the Amaru Treasury Withdrawal Governance Action, which has reached 59% DRep approval.

Discussions were held regarding the GovTools’ funding, with support expressed due to its existing infrastructure and lack of viable alternatives, countered by strong opposition citing concerns about API quality, centralization, and the incentivized participation model. The Tempo team's new budget info action proposal and the imminent submission of 39 treasury withdrawal proposals from Intersect were also discussed.

## Details  

### Amaru Treasury Withdrawal Governance Action

An update was provided on the Amaru treasury withdrawal governance action, which at the time of the meeting garnered 59% DRep approval. The Cardano Atlantic Council and Cardano Japan Council have deemed it constitutional, with two other ICC votes required for passage. The Cardano Foundation's DRep recommendation, a YES vote, has received approval from the Executive Committee and legal department, with final ICC rationale approval, deeming it as constitutional, pending before voting.

### GovTools Budget Info Action

The GovTools budget info action, submitted 3 July, has gained 15.5% approval from the DReps. The requested funds have been reduced from an initial 2 million ada to 1.15 million ada. 

#### Discussion on GovTool’s Funding

Support was expressed for funding GovTool, acknowledging its imperfections but emphasizing its value as existing infrastructure and the absence of viable alternatives. It was noted that the tool is a complex infrastructure, including additional indexers, which contributes to its costs. While the price is high, the tiered pricing structure, which incorporates community funding, was highlighted as demonstrating positive intentions.

#### Opposition to GovTools Funding

Opposition to funding the GovTools was voiced, citing concerns regarding its API quality and its establishment as a centralized, singular data source. Arguments suggested that funding it perpetuates a problematic design and discourages alternative solutions. The proposed incentivized participation was criticized due to a lack of clear rules on fund allocation.

#### Consequences of Not Funding GovTools

The potential consequences of not approving the GovTools proposal were discussed, including the possibility of the tool being shut down, which could hinder seamless participation in governance for the average ada holder. 

#### Alternative Solutions and Governance System Flaws

Arguments against funding were countered by stating that the open economic space of the system allows for better alternatives to emerge if market opportunities are identified. While the GovTools has flaws, it has delivered a functional product. 

### 39 Treasury Withdrawals from Intersect

The team was informed about the upcoming submission of 39 treasury withdrawals by Intersect, anticipated on July 10th or 11th. A standardized governance action metadata template will be utilized. The Cardano Foundation DRep vote is expected to align with previous off-chain Ekklesia votes, with a potential change, from Abstain to Yes, for the Intersect budget due to their reduced requested amount. From the ICC perspective, a unified rationale document will be attached to all votes to streamline the process.
