## Summary  

The Governance Advisory Team meeting on July 16th provided updates on 3 active governance actions, including the ratification of the Amaru Treasury Withdrawal and discussions on the necessity of a new NCL for 2026 before submitting budget Info Actions. The GovTools Budget Info Action is nearing 25% DRep approval, and the Tempo.vote budget Info Action was described as lacking sufficient detail and support. An update was given on the 39 Treasury Withdrawal Governance Actions, which are awaiting a final signature for testing. The Oversight Committee's role in the Treasury Reserve Smart Contract of Intersect was explained. Participants also discussed the future of the Oversight Committee, noting its current pro bono status and the potential need for future compensation.

## Details  

### Live Governance Actions Overview

An update was provided on 3 active Governance Actions. The Amaru Treasury Withdrawal appears to have been ratified on Sunday, meaning funding should be released to the specified smart contract addresses on Friday. It was clarified that ratification occurs when all required thresholds are met, and enactment, which triggers fund flow, happens one epoch later.

#### GovTool Budget Info Action

It was reported that the GovTool budget Info Action has nearly 25% DRep approval and has been deemed constitutional by one ICC member. The governance advisory team has assessed its constitutionality and with the CF DRep will likely recommend a vote in favor, including counterarguments for a comprehensive overview.

#### Tempo.vote Budget Info Action

Tempo.vote submitted a budget Info Action requesting 380,000 ada for infrastructure and development costs, but provided insufficient detail and no reference materials. The proposal's administrative process is unclear, and many DReps are currently not supporting it, with significantly more "No" votes than "Yes" votes. Questions were raised regarding the strength of the administrator requirement in the constitution and the expectations for an administrator's role. Concern was expressed that the proposal's presentation negatively impacts Tempo's chances of approval.

### NCL and Budget Info Actions

The necessity of a new NCL for 2026 was discussed, required before submitting budget Info Actions for that year, particularly for treasury withdrawals. It was suggested that it would be ideal that the NCL be submitted earlier, around mid-September 2025. This would allow sufficient time for approval before the Cardano Summit and other community events. An earlier submission would also ensure appropriate timelines for event and travel planning within the Cardano Community, given the nature of event planning and reliance on specific timelines and budget availability for 3rd party vendors. The importance of having the NCL in place was acknowledged due to differing interpretations of the constitution regarding its necessity for constitutional budgets.

### 39 Treasury Withdrawal Governance Actions

An update was provided on the 39 Treasury Withdrawal Governance Actions, stating that they are awaiting the final signature from 1 Oversight Committee (OC) member to complete the last tests for the transaction. The OC's role is to act as a check and balance on Intersect as administrator, primarily for data assurance tasks. The current testing involves co-signing a small transaction to verify each member's ability to sign. The transaction has a 6-hour expiration, but the test is expected to be successful regardless, as most members have successfully signed.

### Oversight Committee Flow and Responsibilities

The functions of the Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC) were detailed, including funding, dispersal, pausing and resuming, sweeping unused funds back to the treasury, and reorganizing for UTXO management. It was clarified that the Oversight Committee's approvals act as a blocker to disbursement to Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC). Details about the smart contracts can be found [here](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration).

### Future of Oversight Committee and Compensation

The long-term function of the Oversight Committee (OC) was a key discussion point. It was decided that, for the time being, the Foundations OC will operate as an ad hoc group within the Governance Advisory Team, allowing them to accumulate experience.
