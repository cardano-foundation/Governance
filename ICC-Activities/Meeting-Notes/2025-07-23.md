## Summary  

During the Governance Advisory Team meeting on July 23rd, discussions focused on the GovTools and Tempo.vote budget info actions. It was deemed unlikely that GovTools would achieve its approval threshold, and Tempo was considered potentially unconstitutional due to insufficient oversight. Updates were provided on treasury withdrawals approval status and discussions held regarding the approach to on-chain versus off-chain voting results for the 39 proposals. Upcoming governance actions regarding the Constitutional Committee change and its interplay with the treasury withdrawal timeline were discussed.

## Details  

### GovTools Budget Information

The GovTools budget info action is unlikely to reach the >50% approval threshold by its August 2nd expiration, currently standing at 30%. Despite the CF deeming it constitutional and voting "yes‚Äù with the Foundation DRep.

### Temp.vote Discussion

The necessity of the Tempo.vote, given the existence of the  GovTools, was discussed, with the response that it fosters healthy competition. The Tempo budget info action is likely unconstitutional due to the lack of detail in outlining an oversight process for its administration, a requirement under Article 4, Section 2 of the constitution. This assessment was agreed upon, emphasizing the importance of not setting a precedent by approving a minimal proposal, and suggesting encouragement for the Tempo team to resubmit with more detailed information.

### Treasury Withdrawals and Intersect Proposal

It was reported that 39 treasury withdrawal proposals have gone live. The CF plans to vote on these proposals by the end of the week, voting "yes" on the Intersect proposal, a change from their previous abstention. This change is due to Intersect reducing their funding request from 20 million to 15.7 million ada, which was not reflected in the earlier Ekklesia vote.

### Off-chain vs. On-chain Voting Process

An opposing opinion suggested a "yes" vote for all 39 proposals to avoid conflict, arguing that the community had voted for them off-chain, which could lead to a smoother process. However, arguments were made for adhering to the Ekklesia vote, which included abstentions for some proposals, as the off-chain process is not constitutionally defined or aligned with CIP-1694. Support was also expressed for adhering to the original off-chain voting results, viewing the on-chain vote as a formality that duplicates previous work.

### Constitutional Committee Update

The Governance Action to update the Constitutional Committee is expected to be submitted by August 2nd. This action, which will elect seven approved candidates, requires approval from DReps and SPOs, marking the first time SPOs need to approve something since the last constitutional change. It was suggested that the CF Drep votes late on this action to avoid an overlap where the new committee's votes would void the old committee's live governance action votes, thus preventing a slowdown in the assessment process.
