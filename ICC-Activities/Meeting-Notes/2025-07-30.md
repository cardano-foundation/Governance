## Summary  

The Governance Advisory Team meeting on July 30th included updates on the Cardano Foundation DRep's votes on all 39 treasury withdrawals of the Intersect budget and the submission of the “Update Constitutional Committee” governance action for DRep voting. The GovTools and Tempo budget proposals are unlikely to pass due to insufficient approval. Discussions also covered an RFP process for budget allocation, while raising concerns about centralization and proposing an alternative DRep-led budget allocation process. The team decided to maintain their current stance on the RWA proposal for Haus, emphasizing the integrity of the voting process.

## Details  

### Treasury Withdrawals and Governance Actions

An update was provided on governance actions, noting that the Cardano Foundation DRep voted on all 39 treasury withdrawals based on the Intersect Budget Info Action and shared an aggregate rationale. The "Update Constitutional Committee" governance action was submitted, where DReps and SPOs need to vote on it.

### GovTools and Tempo Budget Proposals

The GovTools budget info action, requiring >50% approval, is currently at 40% and is unlikely to pass with two days remaining. Similarly, the Tempo proposal, with 21% approval and deemed unconstitutional by some ICC members, is also unlikely to pass. It was discussed that the Tempo proposal is most likely unconstitutional.

### RFP Process for Budget Allocation

It was suggested that the ecosystem should ask for functionality or services, then have multiple entities bid, rather than individual tools asking for budgets. However, doubts were expressed about the feasibility of an RFP process in a decentralized setting, suggesting it could lead to centralization.

### Haus Proposal and Voting Integrity

The RWA treasury withdrawal proposal for Haus was reviewed, with the CF DRep having initially cast a “Yes” vote. During the discussion, additional insights and concerns were raised regarding the proposal. However, the evidence presented was deemed inconclusive and insufficient to justify a change in the voting position. It was further agreed that, should a clear error be identified, it would be transparently communicated in order to preserve the integrity of the CF voting process. Consequently, the team resolved to maintain the current “Yes” vote unless compelling and verifiable new evidence is provided.

### Constitutional Committee Votes and Future Meetings

All CF DRep votes for the 39 treasury withdrawals are complete, but ICC votes are pending finalization of the rationale. The Atlantic Council and IOG have deemed all 39 proposals constitutional, although some within the Atlantic Council found them unconstitutional due to vague dispute resolution processes. The team agreed to Intersect's request to delay the Cardano Foundation's DRep vote on the "Update Constitutional Committee" governance action until the 39 treasury withdrawals expire on August 17.
