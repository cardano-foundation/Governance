## Details  

### Governance Actions Review and Vote Reconsideration

A review of governance actions noted that 32 out of 39 treasury withdrawals have been enacted or are ratified. A proposal to reconsider "no" vote for the NFTCDN withdrawal was made. A consensus formed around a "yes" vote, with the rationale that the CDN is a critical service that benefits many builders.

### New Constitution Proposal Discussion

A new constitution proposal was discussed, which requires a 75% approval threshold from DReps. The proposal was noted as an overall improvement over the current constitution, particularly with the removal of the budget info action process. However, concerns were raised about the drafting process, with criticisms that it lacked community input and minimum alignment with various committees. The concern was echoed about setting expectations for consultation processes without excessive focus on exact wording. It was noted that the current constitution does not define the amendment process in detail, allowing any community member to suggest changes, but this raises concerns about a single powerful DRep unilaterally updating the constitution in a decentralized governance model.

### Layered Constitutional Updates and Decentralization

A "layered update" approach for the constitution was proposed, suggesting multiple chained updates, starting with less controversial changes like typos and rephrasing, and then moving to more substantial changes like the budget process. This approach would allow for simultaneous submissions and individual voting on specific changes. It was asserted that any individual submitting a constitution update, regardless of a complicated process, demonstrates a decentralized system if the proposal is relevant and well-executed.
