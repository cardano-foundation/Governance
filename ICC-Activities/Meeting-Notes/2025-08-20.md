title: "ICC Governance Meeting - 20 August 2025"
date: "2025-08-20"
summary: "Four active governance actions were reviewed, with urgency on the “Update constitutional committee” before the ICC term ends September 6th, as failure would halt governance. The team has not voted as a DRep, with two members recused. The two SNEK treasury withdrawal proposals were flagged as unconstitutional and criticized for lacking transparency and broader community value, with loans suggested as an alternative. It was stressed that DReps should judge proposals on merit, with abstention a viable option when intent is valid but execution flawed. YUTA’s updated constitution, though low in approval, was welcomed for simplifying withdrawals, improving transparency, and serving as a catalyst for iterative governance improvements."

## Summary  

Four active governance actions were reviewed, with urgency on the “Update constitutional committee” before the ICC term ends September 6th, as failure would halt governance. The team has not voted as a DRep, with two members recused. The two SNEK treasury withdrawal proposals were flagged as unconstitutional and criticized for lacking transparency and broader community value, with loans suggested as an alternative. It was stressed that DReps should judge proposals on merit, with abstention a viable option when intent is valid but execution flawed. YUTA’s updated constitution, though low in approval, was welcomed for simplifying withdrawals, improving transparency, and serving as a catalyst for iterative governance improvements.

## Details  

### Upcoming Governance Actions and Deadlines

Four live governance actions were highlighted, none of which currently meet the required thresholds. The most urgent is the "Update constitutional committee" action, as the ICC term expires on September 6th, and failure to ratify a new one would halt most Cardano governance actions. 

### DRep and SPO Voting Strategy for CC Update

The team has not yet voted on the "Update constitutional committee" governance action as a DRep. Two members (Nicolas Cerny and Matthias Benkort) recused themselves from the assessment due to their involvement with the constitutional committee. 

### SNEK Treasury Withdrawal Proposals

The discussion on two "SNEK" governance actions for treasury withdrawals, which were deemed unconstitutional, was introduced. The SNEK team's activity and success was acknowledged, but the lack of detail in their budget proposal was questioned. It was highlighted that the first withdrawal proposal, requesting 5 million ada, lacked transparency, accountability, and clear details on how the funds would be used, appearing to be primarily in the interest of the SNEK token holder community rather than the broader Cardano community. It was also suggested that treasury funding, if not for open-source initiatives, should be structured as a loan with a commitment for repayment.

### DRep Mandate and Abstention as a Strategy

It was emphasized that the DRep mandate is to judge the merit of a proposal, not its constitutionality, and that voting "no" solely based on unconstitutionality could be problematic. Abstaining was suggested as a middle ground, providing feedback that they support the proposal's intent but deem it not to be at  the expected or required  level. 

Proposed Constitutional Changes from YUTA: The discussion on YUTA’s updated constitution governance action, which currently has low approval, was opened. The new draft was presented as an improvement over the current constitution. The simplification of treasury withdrawal rules and the removal of budget info actions were highlighted as positive changes. It was also noted that some feedback was incorporated, such as withdrawal requirements, improved enforceability, and greater transparency for DReps approving withdrawals.

### Implications of Voting on the Constitution

The question of whether supporting this version of the constitution would be perceived negatively was raised, but it was noted that the current constitution's amendment process is very broad and doesn't mandate previously used formats with workshops or conventions. The new draft was supported, viewing it as a potential catalyst for further updates and iterations on the constitution and highlighting that the current system allows anyone to propose governance actions.
