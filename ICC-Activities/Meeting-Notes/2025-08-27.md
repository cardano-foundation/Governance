## Summary  

The meeting on August 27th focused on the active governance actions. The team discussed the decision to vote “Abstain” on the two SNEK treasury withdrawals governance actions due to a planned resubmission of these proposals with a business loan structure. Discussions on the new constitution governance action leaned towards a 'yes' vote from the DRep perspective. The new constitution is considered unlikely to pass due to its high 75% DRep approval threshold.

## Details  

### Governance Actions and ICC Role

CF’s term as an ICC member would expire at the epoch boundary between 580/581. The governance action to replace the constitutional committee was noted as meeting the required thresholds for ratification. The team will prepare a recap of their work as ICC members, including the number of governance actions reviewed and rationales drafted.

### SNEK Treasury Withdrawal Governance Actions

The team recommended that the CF DRep should vote "abstain" on the SNEK treasury withdrawals governance action. This was a compromise, as the SNEK team intends to resubmit their proposal with a business loan structure. Voting "abstain" was deemed more justifiable than "yes" due to current drawbacks of the proposal.

### New Constitution Governance Action

Discussions on the new constitution governance action revealed that the team is leaning towards a "yes" or "abstain" vote from the DRep perspective, despite initial "no" recommendations from some members. It was noted that the new constitution is unlikely to pass given the high 75% approval threshold by the deadline.
