## Summary  

It was announced that the Cardano Foundation's term as an Interim Constitutional Committee (ICC) member ends on September 6th.

## Details  

### Governance Advisory Team and Interim Constitutional Committee Transition

It was announced that the governance advisory team's first meeting under its new composition was held, with the new process officially enacted. The new process focuses solely on preparing voting recommendations and rationales for the CF DRep. The Cardano Foundation's term as an ICC member is ending with the next epoch boundary, on September 6th, as the new constitutional committee will then be enacted. 

### Review of Governance Actions and Proposals

It was reported that the two SNEK  treasury withdrawal governance actions had expired, as they were deemed unconstitutional by the ICC and received low DRep votes. It was also stated that YUTA’s new constitution governance action is unlikely to meet the 75% approval threshold from the DRep site. The Cardano Foundation DRep will vote "yes" on it, and the need for clear communication was emphasized.

### Cardano in Oceania Proposal Budget Review

The team discussed a new governance action, the "Cardano in Oceania" proposal, which was submitted on the 1st of September, 2025. It was suggested to consult with internal subject matter experts on the proposal. This initiative was described as a business development effort for enterprise adoption in an underrepresented region, with KPIs and involvement from a partner organization for refinement. Concerns were raised about the chosen administrator due to their past involvement in a previously deemed unconstitutional governance action and the potential for a conflict of interest. The proposal was deemed reasonable in its scope and cost, representing a low risk from a treasury standpoint. The importance of accountability and reviewing the KPIs was also emphasized.

### Upcoming Governance Actions and Documentation

Several upcoming governance actions were listed, including a re-submission of a budget by the Tempo.vote team, a treasury withdrawal for the previously approved budget for GovTools, a new budget info action from SNEK, and the Cardano Sovereign Wealth Fund budget.
