## Summary

The Governance Advisory Team discussed current governance actions, including updates on the "Cardano in Oceania" budget info action and the SNEK budget info action. A new "Stablecoin DeFi Liquidity Budget" proposal was introduced.

## Details

### Cardano in Oceania Budget Info Action

An update was provided on the Cardano in Oceania budget info action. Despite positive feedback and proposed positive changes, the DRep approval rate is very low, making the proposal unlikely to pass before its October 1st expiration. The team expressed several views on this action, with many positive points made. Further deliberation is required before putting together a recommendation with any areas for improvement.

### SNEK Loan Budget Info Action

The Snek loan budget info action was discussed, which has strong DRep support. However, concerns were raised about the low APR of 2.44%, which is believed to not adequately compensate the treasury for the risk of a zero-collateral loan. It was suggested that funds could be withdrawn in multiple stages, tied to actionable items, to ensure accountability. Some questions were raised about the SNEK team's narrative and overall strategy, as their description of the project has changed over time from  being described as a memecoin with no value and a utility project.

### Stablecoin DeFi Liquidity Budget

A new governance action was introduced, the "Stablecoin DeFi Liquidity Budget," which requests 50 million ADA to mint stablecoins and provide liquidity in the Cardano DeFi ecosystem. A question was raised about the underlying assumption that injecting liquidity would create demand, with the argument that a lack of liquidity often indicates a lack of demand. It was noted that a portion of the funds would be dedicated to minting stablecoins, with mechanisms for repayment and reinvestment of gains back into the treasury. The team decided to review the proposal further before making a recommendation, acknowledging its complexity.
