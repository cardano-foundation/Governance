## Summary

The meeting focused on upcoming votes for live governance actions. Two new governance actions were also discussed: one on defining the Cardano 2030 vision and strategy and a Treasury withdrawal governance action for GovTool. The team also reviewed the stablecoin DeFi liquidity budget and its two-level governance system.

## Details

### New Governance Actions and GovTools Budget

Two new governance actions were introduced: an info action on defining the Cardano 2030 vision and strategy, which was submitted anonymously, and a Treasury withdrawal governance action for the previously approved GovTools budget, requesting 1,150,000 ADA for 12 months of maintenance and development.

### Stablecoin DeFi Liquidity Budget Review

The team began reviewing the stablecoin DeFi liquidity budget, noting its extensive metadata and additional documents. The two-level governance system, involving an admin committee and a Treasury DAO, made up of Cardano DReps, was discussed. Concerns were raised about the ability of committee members to remove others without clear limits, OTC transaction execution, and a rule allowing only one voting action in the Treasury DAO at a time. The latter was noted as a potential vulnerability that could allow a corrupt member to block impeachment actions. The selection process for DEXes and lending protocols was discussed, with the idea of issuing requests to protocols for specific needs. It was clarified that there would be a maximum of two protocols per category, such as lending and DEXs.
