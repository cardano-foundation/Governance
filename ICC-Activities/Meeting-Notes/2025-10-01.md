## Summary

The meeting provided an overview of five live governance actions, including the Cardano in Oceania budget and the SNEK loan budget proposal. Key discussions focused on the Cardano 2030 Vision and Strategy info action and the Stablecoin DeFi Liquidity Budget.

## Details

### Meeting Overview and Live Governance Actions

The weekly meeting highlighted five live governance actions. The Cardano in Oceania budget is unlikely to be approved with only 10% approval, while the SNEK loan-based budget proposal has 63% approval and is set to expire in five days.

### Cardano 2030 Vision and Strategy

The team discussed the info action seeking input on the Cardano 2030 vision and strategy, submitted to gather feedback for the product committee.

### Stablecoin DeFi Liquidity Budget

This proposal currently stands at 28% approval, with an expectation that a large entity's "yes" vote could push it higher. There is a lack of complete consensus among the team regarding the proposal and discussion was held on the following:

### KPI Accuracy

Some observations were made regarding the consistency and plausibility of certain KPI calculations, including revenue projections that appeared unusually high. This raised questions about the overall reliability of the proposal's quantitative assumptions.

### Transparency and Accountability

It was noted that the governance protocol could benefit from greater clarity on procedures related to potential conflicts of interest and administrative decision-making. While the topic is addressed in the documentation, further elaboration on implementation and oversight mechanisms could enhance confidence in the process.

### Feedback Approach

It was suggested that the governance advisory team communicate the reasoning behind a vote in a constructive manner - acknowledging alignment with the broader strategic objectives while identifying areas that may need further refinement. There was also discussion around timing considerations for the vote to ensure due diligence and process integrity. Near-term feedback will prioritize practical aspects such as proposal clarity, rather than technical implementation details.
