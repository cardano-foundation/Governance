## Summary

The meeting provided an overview of current governance actions. with some participants noting differing views on the decision to support the Stablecoin DeFi Liquidity Budget despite certain unresolved aspects. It was observed that such decisions could have broader implications for future precedent-setting. The conversation also touched on perceived limitations in Catalyst's cubic root voting mechanism and emphasized the importance of strengthening internal processes to enable earlier and more structured feedback on CF-associated proposals.

## Details

### Past Governance Actions

The team reviewed the four live governance actions. The SNEK Loan Budget Info Action expired on October 6th and successfully met the approval threshold with overwhelming DRep approval. However, it was noted that if it had been a Treasury withdrawal, it would not have met the 67% approval threshold required.

### DeFi Liquidity Budget Proposal

The DeFi Liquidity Budget Proposal currently has over 30% DRep approval, needing to meet the 50% threshold. CF decided to vote "yes" on this proposal despite acknowledged shortcomings.

### Catalyst's Cubic Root Voting Logic

The team discussed the cubic root voting logic implemented in Catalyst Fund 14, noting that it reduces the voting power of large ada holders to make their impact negligible. It was highlighted that wallet splitting was observed - creating numerous small wallets to gain more voting power.
