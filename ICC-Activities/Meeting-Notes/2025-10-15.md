## Summary

The meeting confirmed the passage of the Stablecoin DeFi Liquidity budget info action (65% approval) and next steps for its Treasury withdrawals.

## Details

### DeFi Liquidity Budget and Next Steps

The Stablecoin DeFi liquidity budget info action passed with 65% approval. The proposer is now planning the first Treasury withdrawal, the second withdrawal shall be pending the establishment of a legal setup as set out in the proposal.

### SNEK team and Treasury withdrawal

A follow-up meeting was held with the SNEK team where they agreed to publicly share their loan agreement, a non-negotiable requirement for the CF DRep. This agreement is expected to accompany their upcoming Treasury withdrawal governance action. It was noted that the SNEK team's desire for budget flexibility is appropriate for their business scaling model.

### Treasury Status and Withdrawal Limits (NCL)

It was clarified that around 272 million ada has been withdrawn from the Treasury this year, leaving around 78 million ada available of the current NCL. The team also noted that the NCL (Net Change Limit) expires on December 31st, with the budget committee working on a proposal for a new NCL for 2026, which has to be approved via an info action.

### GovTools Treasury Withdrawal and Oversight

A rationale for the GovTool treasury withdrawal (1.5 million ada) was discussed, as the budget was previously approved by DReps. Intersect will serve as the administrator of the budget.

### New Constitution Governance Action

It was noted that a newly submitted draft for Update Constitution governance action is a positive iterative improvement. The new version simplifies the budget and treasury withdrawal sections and removes unnecessary clauses found in the previous version (2.0).
