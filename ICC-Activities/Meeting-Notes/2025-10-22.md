## Summary

The meeting focused on reviewing 4 live governance actions, including new submissions from the Cardano Foundation and Constitutional Committee (CC) members. Concerns were raised regarding the inconsistent participation of some CC members and the low approval of the GovTools treasury withdrawal. A significant debate centered on a CC compensation proposal, with strong opposition to the proposal. The team also prepared for a "yes" vote on Constitution 2.3 and discussed a CF-submitted governance action for the .ada and .cardano top-level domain.

## Details

### Update on Governance Actions and CC Participation

On October 22nd, 4 governance actions are live, including a new submission from the CF and a budget info action from 5 of the 7 CC members. The expired "Defining the Cardano 2030 Vision & Strategy" action received low DRep approval (26.22%). The GovTools treasury withdrawal currently has low approval at 26%, needing 67% by October 26th, unlikely to meet the threshold.

### Constitution 2.3

The team debated the vote on Constitution 2.3, noting key improvements such as enhanced accountability, transparency clauses, required auditors for funding requests, and the removal of non-enforceable language. The document is being reviewed for any critical changes to guardrails.

### Constitutional Committee (CC) Compensation Proposal

A budget info action was presented from five CC members requesting 200,000 ada each for their activities. The funding justification was based on an estimated 10 hours of review per action for 36 governance actions per year, calculating to an hourly rate of around 100 ada. Concerns were raised that the high payment could attract unqualified individuals and create a "money-driven" incentive rather than skill-based in the future. There was a consensus that a clear framework, including a code of conduct and criteria for payment, is needed before remuneration. It was also suggested that there might be a  need for governance process changes (e.g., a larger CC size) rather than financial compensation. In the defense of the proposal, it was argued that adequate funding is necessary to ensure CC independence and to prevent corruption.

### CF-Submitted Governance Action

The CF submitted a governance action seeking community approval to pursue an application for the .ada and .cardano top-level domains. This aims to gauge community sentiment and provide proof of community support for the application. The team debated whether the CF should vote "abstain" or "yes" on its own proposal.
