## Summary

The meeting reviewed the results of the GovTools treasury withdrawal (56% approval) and discussed the high probability of approval for the new Constitution. Critical focus was placed on the SNEK treasury withdrawal loan agreement, identifying a possible discrepancy between the GA metadata and the loan agreement. The team also covered the CC compensation budget info action, the CF's TLD info action progress, and a new governance action seeking reimbursement for a lost governance action deposit.

## Details

### GovTools Treasury Withdrawal and Constitution Update

The GovTools treasury withdrawal failed to meet the 67% threshold, achieving only 56% approval. It was suggested that the over 1 million ada request was a significant barrier for DReps and should be split or reduced.

The new Constitution governance action is likely to be approved, with key DReps supporting a "yes" vote. There was debate over the efficiency of the new requirement for independent auditors for every Treasury withdrawal. The definition of an "independent auditor" was discussed, noting the lack of a clear definition.

### Constitutional Committee (CC) Compensation and TLD Governance Actions

The CC compensation GA is highly unpopular and unlikely to pass. The GA is still seen as positive as it initiated a broader discussion on compensation for governance work.

Positive progress was observed in the info action the Cardan Foundation submitted to seek community approval for applying for top-level domains (.ada and .cardano) for the Cardano ecosystem, with approval surpassing 30% after one week.

### SNEK Treasury Withdrawal Loan Agreement Concerns

A potential issue was identified in the SNEK loan agreement: the metadata specifies repayment to the Cardano Treasury, but the agreement itself directs repayment only to the Cardano Development Holding (CDH). This leaves a gap, as there is no clause ensuring CDH repays the Treasury. The team suggested that Intersect (who controls CDH) should issue a public commitment to bridge this gap and to update this in the final loan agreement.

Additional concerns were raised about the loan agreement referring to itself as an "annex to a master service agreement," suggesting potential overriding terms that require further review.

Non-negotiable requirements for the withdrawal from CF included the loan agreement being public and clarification on the "use of fund" clause. The team noted that the strong recommendation for a phased withdrawal was not implemented, as it remains a single withdrawal.

### Reimbursement for Lost Governance Action Deposit

A new governance action seeks reimbursement for 100,000 ADA accidentally donated to the Treasury by not registering their stake credential when they paid the 100k ada governance action deposit. It was clarified that this mistake can no longer happen due to a Cardano node bug fix, and the reimbursement action is widely considered correct.
