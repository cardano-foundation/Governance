## Summary

The meeting focused on live governance actions: New Constitution governance action is unlikely to pass despite high approval among DReps (65% approval, needs 75%). Concerns were raised about the Snek loan treasury withdrawal, specifically inconsistencies in the repayment schedule and language. Updates were also provided on the CC compensation and TLD proposals, Intersect's plan for nine governance actions by year-end, and the ongoing Intersect Executive Director search.

## Details

### New Constitution

The new constitution governance action is set to expire on the day of the meeting and is unlikely to meet the 75% approval threshold, currently standing at 65%. It was noted that if the opposition were to vote "abstain" instead of "no," the proposal could pass the 75% mark. Reasoning behind unconvinced community members remains unclear, concerns have been raised about potential complications in the audit requirements.

### Current State of Other Governance Actions

The constitutional committee compensation proposal has very low approval. The securing top-level domains governance action stands at 38% approval.

### SNEK Loan Treasury Withdrawal Concerns

The voting decision on the Snek loan treasury withdrawal is pending as the Snek team has not yet addressed the identified inconsistencies.

- **Repayment Schedule Inconsistency:** The loan agreement only commits to repayment at the end of the loan term, contradicting the budget info action, which suggested payments would begin from year three. The loan agreement further specifies that an agreement on a repayment plan with Intersect would only happen at year three.
- **Repayment Recipient Issue:** The loan agreement's language is problematic as it directs repayment to the Cardano Development Holding (CDH), not the Cardano Treasury. The repayment schedule was viewed as a more critical issue due to the extended commitment time.

### Ikigai Info Action Rationale

A key concern for the info action is that the stake address used for the current action does not match the one that lost the initial 100,000 ADA, making identity verification difficult. It was suggested that the entity could sign with their stake key to prove ownership of the previous stake key or use the previous unregistered stake address as the payout to prevent fraudulent claims.

### Future Governance Actions and Intersect

We were informed that Intersect plans to submit up to nine governance actions by year-end, including budget info actions, a parameter change, vision/strategy info action, and a new Net Change Limit. The proposed NCL will be discussed by the budget committee, with recommendations ranging from 217 to 330 million ADA.

The hiring process for a permanent Executive Director for Intersect is ongoing, with a shortlist of three candidates and a final decision expected after the end of the year.
