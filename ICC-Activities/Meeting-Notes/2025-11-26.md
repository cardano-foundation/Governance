## Summary

The primary point of discussion of the meeting was the retirement of the Cadano Atlantic Council from the Constitutional Committee (CC), which effectively paused the ratification of CC-dependent governance actions due to being below the minimum required size of CC. To address this, Intersect has launched a snap election and the team discussed the candidates for the vacant spot. Also updates were presented on expired governance actions.

## Details

### Governance Action Recap

Three actions ended at the epoch boundary on November 25th, 2025:

- The Cardano Foundation's info action regarding securing GTLDs was approved by 74% of the DReps, showing a strong community signal.
- The Snek treasury withdrawal was approved by 76% of DReps, ratifying the withdrawal of 5 million ADA.
- The reimbursement for the Ikigai info action deposit was also approved, passing the 50% DRep approval threshold.

### Constitutional Committee (CC) Min Size and Snap Election

The Cardano Atlantic Council retired from the CC, resulting in the number of CC members, now 6, below the required threshold of 7. This means no governance action requiring CC approval can currently be ratified on-chain. Intersect is conducting a snap election to quickly fill the vacant CC spot. The team has discussed the candidates and agreed on the supported candidate to recommend to the Executive Committee.

- Voting: An off-chain DRep voting period starts on November 26th and lasts 10 days until December 5th.
- Timeline: The goal is to submit an updated committee governance action by December 8th.
- Approval Requirements: This action requires 67% DRep approval and 51% Stake Pool Operator (SPO) approval. Due to the holiday season, SPO communication is stressed to encourage quick voting.
