## Summary

The core discussion centered on the Cardano Critical Integrations Budget (CIB). A second key discussion was the necessity of the Net Change Limit (NCL) extension governance action to prevent the CIB withdrawal from being deemed unconstitutional. Finally, CC snap election's preliminary results were discussed.

## Details

### Critical Integrations Budget

The governance action requests 70 million ada to enable critical integrations (stablecoins, bridges, oracles) and has already received 69% approval. The associated Treasury withdrawal is planned for submission within the next few days. The proposal was considered to lack detailed cost breakdowns, timelines, and essential information. Despite these shortcomings, the team determined that participation was a necessary strategic move to maintain engagement and alignment with the roadmap. The consensus included the intention to advocate for improved governance structure and disclosures within the steering committee.

### Net Change Limit (NCL) Extension Governance Action

The NCL extension governance action is deemed necessary because the 2025 NCL expires on January 4th. Due to a one-epoch lag between vote ratification and the ledger's computation of the withdrawal, the Critical Integrations Budget withdrawal could potentially fall outside the current NCL's limit, leading to the Constitutional Committee (CC) deeming it unconstitutional. Voting for the NCL extension is affirmed as a necessity to prevent the unconstitutionality of the Treasury withdrawal.

### Constitutional Committee (CC) Snap Election

Discussions where had centered around the CC snap election, where Cardano Curia had overtaken Christina Gianelloni, the candidate CF has chosen to support. Concern was expressed over credential readiness and general suitability for the role. It was agreed that CF would reach out to Intersect to check if assistance can be provided to ensure candidates are prepared to take on the role promptly after appointment.
