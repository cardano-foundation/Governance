title: "Governance Advisory Team Meeting - 17 December 2025"
date: "2025-12-17"
summary: "The primary discussion focused on the new governance action to add Christina Gianelloni, the runner up of the CC snap election, as the 8 Constitutional Committee (CC) member. The team agreed that the Treasury withdrawal for Critical Integrations Budget (CIB) must be prioritized due to the risk of a timing collision with vote for Christina's candidacy, which could halt the withdrawal's ratification. The consensus was to vote on the Treasury withdrawal immediately and observe the voting behaviour for Christina until the expiration data of the CIB withdrawal. Communication of this timing issue to co-partners and the wider community was deemed essential."

## Summary

The primary discussion focused on the new governance action to add Christina Gianelloni, the runner up of the CC snap election, as the 8 Constitutional Committee (CC) member. The team agreed that the Treasury withdrawal for Critical Integrations Budget (CIB) must be prioritized due to the risk of a timing collision with vote for Christina's candidacy, which could halt the withdrawal's ratification. The consensus was to vote on the Treasury withdrawal immediately and observe the voting behaviour for Christina until the expiration data of the CIB withdrawal. Communication of this timing issue to co-partners and the wider community was deemed essential.

## Details

### Constitutional Committee (CC) Expansion

A new governance action was submitted to add Christina Gianelloni as the eighth CC member (a candidate the team previously supported in the CC snap election). Adding a member increases the constitutional threshold from five out of seven to six out of eight, which adds complexity. The short remaining term for new members and the potential impact on future election rhythms were also noted.

### Timing of Votes to Avoid Treasury Withdrawal Collision

A critical timing conflict was identified: if Christina's appointment governance action meets the threshold at epoch 605, it could potentially interfere with and push the CIB Treasury withdrawal ratification beyond its expiry date. The team agreed not to risk the ratification of the current Treasury withdrawal and decided to observe the voting behaviour to identify the best timing for voting - either in epoch 603 or 606. To improve community understanding of on-chain ratification, the team recognized the importance of clearly communicating the rationale behind the decision behind timing of voting.
