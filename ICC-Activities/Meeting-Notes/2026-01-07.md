## Summary

The meeting addressed the ratification process of a new constitution (v2.4), emphasizing that community approval through Delegated Representatives (DReps) remains the primary authority for governance transitions. Updates were provided on the execution of the Critical Integrations Budget (CIB) and the status of ongoing governance actions. Significant deliberation occurred regarding the "Cardano 2030 Vision" info action, with concerns raised about its potential use as a sole justification for future budgets, leading to a proposal to formalize the vision as a constitutional amendment. The team also critiqued specific terminology and audit requirements in the latest constitutional draft (v2.4) and debated the sustainability of using the treasury to fund business products with established profit models, suggesting venture capital or loan-based alternatives for such initiatives.

## Details

### Status of Critical Governance Actions

Updates were provided on the progress of the Critical Integrations Budget (CIB) and the Net Change Limit (NCL) extension. The treasury withdrawal of the  CIB of 70 million ada is anticipated to execute at the epoch boundary from 605 to 606 on 9 January 2026. Furthermore, the team noted that the governance action to expand CC membership is unlikely to reach the necessary thresholds before expiration. Consequently, the committee coordinated a strategy to vote on this action in epoch 606 to maintain process integrity and ensure the vote is prepared for submission.

### Cardano 2030 Vision Info Action

The team held a debate regarding the proposed info action for the Cardano 2030 Vision, Mission, and Strategy. While some participants viewed the document as a formality of overarching goals, others expressed strong opposition, fearing the vision could be troublesome in the future if leveraged to justify future budget withdrawals without sufficient due diligence. The team also discussed the idea to incorporate the 2030 Vision as a constitutional amendment rather than an info action. This approach would explicitly define the mission as a prerequisite for budget writing, thereby making any budgets deviating from that vision automatically unconstitutional.

### Constitutional Draft (v2.4) Analysis

The team reviewed version 2.4 of the new constitution, focusing on the terminology shift from "ada Holder" to "ada Owner." Participants considered the change as legally cumbersome and technically imprecise, noting that the protocol only recognizes the control of private keys, holding, rather than the legal concept of ownership. The discussion also addressed audit requirements, where the team favored language requiring "periodic independent audits" over appointing specific auditors. It was concluded that despite terminology concerns, the latest version represents a general improvement and likely includes political concessions necessary to satisfy diverse stakeholder groups.

### Treasury Sustainability and Funding Models

Regarding the budget info action for DeltaDeFi, the team deliberated on the appropriateness of using the treasury to fund projects with established business models. Concerns were raised that funding profit-oriented products, risks depleting the treasury and hinders the ecosystem's ability to become self-sustaining. The team suggested that such projects should instead seek funding through venture capital frameworks or utilize loan models to ensure a commitment to profitability and accountability.
