title: "Governance Advisory Team Meeting - 14 January 2026"
date: "2026-01-14"
summary: "The team reviewed six active governance actions, prioritizing the Cardano 2030 and Constitution 2.4 proposals. The action to add Christina to the Constitutional Committee is expected to fail due to process-related opposition from other voters. A significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to the DeltaDeFi budget proposal, which faces community unpopularity. Finally, while there is systemic concern with the Net Change Limit (NCL) as a budgeting tool, the team supports the current proposal to ensure funding continuity for critical projects."

## Summary

The team reviewed six active governance actions, prioritizing the Cardano 2030 and Constitution 2.4 proposals. The action to add Christina to the Constitutional Committee is expected to fail due to process-related opposition from other voters. A significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to the DeltaDeFi budget proposal, which faces community unpopularity. Finally, while there is systemic concern with the Net Change Limit (NCL) as a budgeting tool, the team supports the current proposal to ensure funding continuity for critical projects.

## Details

### Constitutional Committee Member Addition (Christina)

The proposal is likely to fail, currently sitting at 47% approval (against a 67% requirement). Opposition from DReps with high voting power stems from perceived deviations from Intersect's established processes. The team noted a fundamental misunderstanding in the community that Intersect's platform dictates the protocol's process, whereas Christina's actions remained compliant with the Constitution.

### DeltaDeFi Budget Info Action

Currently unpopular with a high percentage of "no" votes. Some members view the proposal as premature, citing concerns about using Treasury funds for commercial entities and the mixing of platform buildout with vision-related reporting. Despite these concerns, there is a lean toward a "yes" vote due to the quality of the team and the pioneering nature of using the scaling solution Hydra for DeFi. The goal is to provide a coherent rationale that supports the infrastructure while acknowledging the Treasury's current limitations as a funding vehicle.

### Treasury NCL Proposal (350M ada over 100 Epochs)

The NCL is viewed by some in the team as an inappropriate budgeting method that acts more as a spending anchor than a true limit. There is a strong desire to rethink decentralised budgeting andmove away from centralized annual budgets. Additionally, there is ongoing frustration regarding the lack of mandatory reporting on KPIs for funded initiatives, contrasted with the rigidity of the NCL requirements. Despite these views, the team supports the current NCL proposal due to its necessity.
