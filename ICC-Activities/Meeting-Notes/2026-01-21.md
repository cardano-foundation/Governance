## Summary

The meeting highlighted major governance milestones, including the successful enactment of the new Cardano Constitution v2.4 and the approval of the Cardano 2030 Vision. Much of the debate centered on the Net Change Limit (NCL), where members expressed concern with current figures while acknowledging its necessity for critical projects funding. The team also discussed a protocol parameter change to increase transaction and block memory units to benefit smart contract complexity and Hydra.

## Details

### Governance Enactments and Milestones

- **Cardano Constitution:** Formally enacted at epoch 609. It streamlines the constitution and removes the requirement for Budget Info Actions. It was noted that the Constitutional Committee (CC) approved these changes despite procedural objections raised by the Eastern Cardano Council.
- **Cardano 2030 Vision:** The action was approved with ca. 68% DRep approval. The team is now looking for Intersect to pick this up for a formal roadmap announcement.

### Active Governance Actions

- **DeltaDeFi Budget Info Action:** The proposal currently lacks broad community support (46% "no" votes). The team reached a provisional consensus to support the action as a means of funding public goods, specifically DeFi analysis reports and dashboards, while maintaining strict performance expectations for future iterations.
- **Net Change Limit (NCL):** A proposal for a 350M ada limit remains live until 8 February 2026. Internal debate highlighted a preference for a more conservative or formulaic approach to treasury limits. However, the operational necessity of the NCL was affirmed to ensure that critical engineering projects can continue to draw allocated funds without interruption.
- **Protocol Parameter Change:** The team evaluated an increase in transaction and block memory units. This technical adjustment is intended to reduce developer optimization overhead and enable more complex Plutus contracts. It is specifically identified as a resolution for scaling bottlenecks in Hydra.
- **Cardano DeFi Liquidity Budget:** A treasury withdrawal request for 500k ada was introduced for the establishment of legal and smart contract frameworks. A detailed technical review is scheduled for the following week.

### Treasury Administration and Oversight

The team reviewed the performance of existing budget administrators, noting inconsistencies in reporting detail and internal organizational structure. Discussion explored the feasibility of transitioning toward alternative or decentralized administration models. The increased use of smart multisigs for self-administration was cited as a viable template for improving transparency and reducing reliance on centralized intermediaries.
