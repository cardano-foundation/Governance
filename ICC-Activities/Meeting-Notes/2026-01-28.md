## Summary

The meeting centered on the implications of the newly enacted Cardano Constitution (effective 24 January 2026), which introduces stricter requirements for immutable metadata. Strategies were formulated to increase Stake Pool Operator (SPO) participation for the currently live Parameter Change governance action to increase the transaction and block memory units. Concerns were raised regarding the constitutional compliance of the DeFi Stablecoin Liquidity Budget withdrawal.

## Details

### Constitutional and Regulatory Updates

As of the latest epoch boundary from epoch 608 to 609 (24 January 2026), all governance actions must adhere to the updated Constitution. Primary mandates include the requirement for immutable metadata (e.g., hosted on IPFS). Notably, budget info actions are no longer constitutionally mandated.

### Review of Active Governance Actions

- **DeltaDeFi Action:** A "yes" vote has been recorded for this action. Although it is now categorized as a non-mandatory info action under the new constitution, the team maintained its support based on the proposal's technical merits.
- **Net Change Limit (NCL):** The Foundation intends to support the NCL governance action, which would bring current approval levels to approximately 49%. The action remains active until 8 February 2026.
- **Technical Parameter Changes (Hard Fork):** The rationale for increasing transaction and block memory units was reviewed. Current SPO approval (approx. 7%) is significantly below the 51% threshold required for enactment. To address the low SPO turnout, the team will coordinate a technical discussion X space involving developers, who initiated the action, and community technical experts. The objective is to present technical benchmarks and advocate for the scaling benefits this change provides to dApps and Hydra performance.
- **DeFi Stablecoin Liquidity Budget (500,000 ADA):** Internal review identified a potential violation of the new Constitution, as the proposal's metadata is not immutable. There is a secondary concern regarding the volatility of ada prices since the withdrawal was initially submitted, potentially impacting the budget available for legal setup costs.

### Hard Fork Feature Consultation

Concerns were expressed regarding the limited scope of the upcoming hard fork, which focuses primarily on Plutus primitives. It was discussed that establishing a formal info action process for future hard forks would ensure community consultation on feature sets before implementation.
