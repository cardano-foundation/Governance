# Meeting Notes of Cardano Foundation as an Interim Constitutional Committee Member

## Background  

The Interim Constitutional Committee (ICC) is a governance body within the Cardano ecosystem responsible for overseeing constitutional compliance and ensuring governance processes align with the principles established in the [Interim Constitution](https://constitution.gov.tools/en/interim-constitution). As a member of the ICC, the Cardano Foundation participates in discussions, assessments, and voting on governance actions proposed by ada holders.

The ICC's key responsibilities include:

- Assessing the constitutionality of governance actions.  
- Providing recommendations and rationales for actions requiring community or stakeholder votes.  
- Ensuring transparency and adherence to governance principles during the interim period until a finalized constitution is adopted.  

These meeting notes reflect the Cardano Foundation's contributions and perspective as an ICC member and are intended to provide insights into our deliberations and decisions.

## Purpose
