# Meeting Notes of Cardano Foundation as an Interim Constitutional Committee Member

## Background  

The Interim Constitutional Committee (ICC) is a governance body within the Cardano ecosystem responsible for overseeing constitutional compliance and ensuring governance processes align with the principles established in the [Interim Constitution](https://constitution.gov.tools/en/interim-constitution). As a member of the ICC, the Cardano Foundation participates in discussions, assessments, and voting on governance actions proposed by ada holders.

The ICC's key responsibilities include:

- Assessing the constitutionality of governance actions.  
- Providing recommendations and rationales for actions requiring community or stakeholder votes.  
- Ensuring transparency and adherence to governance principles during the interim period until a finalized constitution is adopted.  

These meeting notes reflect the Cardano Foundation's contributions and perspective as an ICC member and are intended to provide insights into our deliberations and decisions.

## Purpose  

These meeting notes provide transparency into the deliberations and decision-making processes of the Cardano Foundation as an Interim Constitutional Committee (ICC) member. They are intended for the Cardano community to better understand the rationale and internal discussions surrounding governance actions.

## Disclaimer on Interpretation
